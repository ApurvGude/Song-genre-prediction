Simply 'cause our hair is long?
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Picket lines (Brother) and picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother) with brutality (Brother)

[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

[Verse 2]
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to heal me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

[Bridge]
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual Healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby
Ohhh

[Verse 3]
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

[Chorus]
When I get this feeling
I need Sexual Healing
Oh when I get this feeling
I need Sexual Healing
I gotta have Sexual Healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual Healing, darling
'Till you come back home

Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate
[Verse 1]
I’ve been really trying, baby
Trying to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel baby
Come on, oh come on, ooh

[Chorus]
Let’s get it on, ow baby
Let’s get it on, let’s love baby
Let’s get it on, sugar
Let’s get it on, woo

[Verse 2]
We’re all sensitive people with so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be, let’s live, I love you
There’s nothing wrong with me loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby ooh

[Bridge]
Don’t you know how sweet and wonderful life can be, ooh ooh
I’m asking you baby to get it on with me, ooh ooh ooh
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push, I won't push you baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating round the bush, hey
[Verse 3]
Let's get it on, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on baby, let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, let's get it on baby
This minute, oh yeah let's get it on
Please, let's get it on hey hey

[Bridge]
I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you baby?
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy
I ain't gonna worry, no I ain't gonna push
I won't push you baby, woo
Come on, come on, come on, come on darling
Stop beatin' round the bush, hey

[Refrain]
Oh, gonna get it on, threatenin' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you
Let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey hey
Girl, you give me good feeling
So good somethin' like sanctified
Oh dear I, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me just let your self go
Oh baby, let's get it on
[Verse 1]
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-not's
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it

[Chorus]
Oh, make you want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

[Chorus]
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
Make me want to holler
The way they do my life
[Verse 3]
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes

[Chorus]
Make me want to holler
And throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me want to holler
And throw up both my hands

[Verse 4]
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

[Outro]
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply because we wear our hair long
[Verse 1]
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say "believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear"
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Outro]
Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I used to go out to parties
And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls
I done got myself together baby
And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance

Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me spread out and let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone

Move it up
Turn it 'round
Shake it down
OOWWWW

You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe

Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it)
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin' (You got to get it, oh darling)
Got to give it up

Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

If you want to dance, dance
So good
Dancing
[?]
So good
You got me babe
It's so good
[?]
[?]
Spend the night

[Verse 1]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

[Verse 1]
I give you all the love I want in return sweet darling
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me now
But I'm going to change your mind, someway, somehow, oh baby

[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

[Verse 2]
This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care? Ain't it lonely out there?
[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
When I get down with you, yes, darlin oh ooh

[Outro]
Get down baby
Have mercy
Listen precious I wanted you
A long time
I wanted you
More than you can imagine
Oh baby, so fine
I want you - the right way baby
I want you baby
But I want you to want me too baby
Gotta, gotta, gotta love me sugar
Oh, the way that I love you
Woooo, I want you
[Verse 1]
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sure moving down the line
I come up hard, baby, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way

[Verse 2]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Going to keep moving, going to roll to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things that's for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

[Bridge]
This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Got me singing, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Verse 3]
I come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of my business with all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way
[Verse 4]
I know some places and I've seen some faces
I got good connections aimed in my direction
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care about the weather
Don't care about no trouble, got myself together
I feel the kind of protection that's all around me

[Verse 5]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Moving, going to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, baby
Hey ain't gon' let it sweat me, baby

[Outro]
I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sugar, hey, moving down the line
[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read

[Verse 2]
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than, it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?

[Verse 3]
Are they still getting down
Where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant
Do you think, they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me, what's out and I want to know what's in

[Verse 4]
What's the deal man
What's happening? Tell me brother
What's happening brother?
Ah, what's happening brother?
What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, whoo, what's happening brother?
[Outro]
What's been shaking up and down the line?
I want to know because, I'm slightly behind the times
[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh and, I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me
[Outro]
Flying high in a friendly sky
Flying high in a friendly sky
[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye]
As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

[Verse 4: Marvin Gaye]
Distant lover, ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it
Like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
Lord, have mercy

[Outro: Marvin Gaye]
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
Please, please, please
Oh please baby
Come back home, little girl
Oh baby please, please
[Verse 1]
You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Ooo darling how could we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce

[Verse 2]
Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can never really outweigh the bad
Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby

[Verse 3]
It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darling
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
Oh oh ohhh it's much too late
Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy
[Verse 1]
Sunny, yesterday my heart was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you

[Verse 2]
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel about ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

[Verse 3]
Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Yeah sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
Oh my life was torn like wind blown sand
Then a rock was formed when you held my hand
Sunny one so true, I love you
Yes, yes

[Verse 4]
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh you're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you
[Verse 5]
Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh you're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Oh, sunny one so true, I love you
[Verse 1]
I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares, to save a world in despair?
Who really cares?
There'll come a time (There'll come a time)
When the world won't be singing (When the world won't be singing)
Flowers won't grow (flowers won't grow, no)
Bells won't be ringing (the bells won't be ringing)
Who really cares? (Who really cares?)
Who's willing to try? (Who is willing to try?)
To save the world, (to save the world)
That's destined to die (that is destined to die)
When I look at the world (when I look at the world)
It fills me with sorrow (it fills me with sorrow)
Little children today (children today)
Are really going to suffer tomorrow (really suffer tomorrow)
(Oh!) What a shame (what a shame)
Such a bad way to live (such a bad way to live)
Oh, who is to blame? (Who is to blame?)
We can't stop living, (when we can't stop living)
Live, (Live)
(Live for life) Live for life
(But let live everybody)
Live life for the children (live life for...the children. Oh, for the Children)
You see, let's...let's save the children
Let's...let's save all the children, (Save the babies, save the babies!)
(And if you want to love, you got to....save the babies)
(Oh you've got the feeling, you've got the feeling)
(You will save the babies, all of the Children)
[Verse 2]
But who really cares?
Who's willing to try?
To save our world
To save our sweet world
To save a world
That is destined...to die
Oh, la la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody
[Verse 1]
Don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He made this world for us to live in (He made this world)
And gave us everything (Lord gave us everything)
And all he asks of us (Peace!) is we give each other love, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Don't go and talk about my father
Because God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it (Just loves us, oh yeah)
And He'll forgive all our sins, (He'll forgive our sins) forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, oh yeah, is we give each other love, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, love your brother

[Verse 3]
Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
And when we call on Him for mercy, mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know-
[Verse 1]
Has anyone here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 2]
Has anyone here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 3]
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 4]
Has anybody here seen my friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But the good, they die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone
Oh I, just looked around and they were gone
[Intro] (Spoken)
You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

[Verse 1]
Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it

Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time

Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger

Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part

[Bridge]
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried, really tried
(All that rehearsing, baby)
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name

[Verse 2]
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine

Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side

Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied

Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life

I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight

It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

[Refrain/Outro]
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
[Verse 1]
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and
I thought that you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
You'd want to trust me
Oh, in my dream I was loving you
Every place that you wanted me to
Since I believe in dreams and fantasies
I'd like to make love to you right there baby
Ooh, I've got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passions flowing like wine
Baby, baby, please let me do it to you

[Verse 2]
[Oh no, I never gave up no head] I never, gave head before
But there's always the first time you know
So I made up my mind, soon I'll be loving you
That's all I'm interested in, I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm going to do
I can't wait to touch you, to give you that feeling
Eat you up my dear so that your mood will be revealing baby
And soon as I know I've got you willing baby
I'm going to give you some head baby
[giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you [Gonna give you some head!]]
I'm gone knock you right up woman
I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, because I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janis
You're so fine, oh how I love you
[Chorus]
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort

[Verse 1]
(I want to be your lover)
I want to understand your moods, baby
(I want to be your lover)
I really, really
(I want to be your lover)
When you want some solitude, sugar
(I want to be your lover)
You can have it, ooh yeah baby
(I want to be your lover)
Darling, please walk around nude (three times a day)
So I can get you baby
I want to intrude at least (three times a day)
In all the ways baby, whoo
You can have your way if you decide to stay
So

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ooh, this is where all your fantasies end
Let me explore all your treasures
I'll turn you on to all of those freakish pleasures
Good experienced company
Like me who knows all the ways
Is what you need baby
Just you and me locked up for days
After we eat breakfast in bed
Turn on the music for our head

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, Angel, come on Go with me
Please, come on go with me
I said please
Sweet little thing
It's no mystery
How much I want you
I want you baby
I want you
I want you, can't you see?
I'll give you everything
Sweet, little sexy thing
I want you to live with me
Come on Sweet thing
Come on live with me, girl
Come on baby
[Intro]
Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other

[Verse 1]
I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes

[Verse 2]
Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air

[Verse 3]
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on

[Bridge]
Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on

[Verse 4]
For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

[Verse 5]
For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else

[Verse 6]
Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love

[Verse 7]
Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby
[Chorus: Gordon Banks (through a vocoder)]
Sanctified, sanctified

Herpes germ everywhere (sanctified)
Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care (hit it, sanctified)
Some girls smoke, some girls taste
Some girls toot, some girls base, oh baby (sanctified)
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swing with Dick, swing with Joan
So I'm looking for a sanctified lady
[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
That's what I want, a sanctified lady
A girl who wants a sanctified pussy
Good to me, a sanctified lady

Who believes in God

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
I need a sanctified lady for my heart
A sanctified lady
I can respect a sanctified lady
Best love wet, a sancti-sanctified pussy
I can respect a sanctified lady
Bring my children in the world
I want a sanctified lady
[Verse 5: Marvin Gaye]
Think I'll go get me a good old church girl
Savin' for Jesus (Jesus)
It's what I need
She said I'm saving mine for Jesus (Jesus)
Oh lord, what I need
A good girl, I want a sanctified lady
A girl who loves Jesus
A sanctified lady
Make love to me all night long
Sanctified lady
Woman I'll love all my life
I ain't gon' marry until I find a sanctified pussy
[Chorus]
I’m yours (I’m yours) and you're mine (you're mine)
You are mine (you're mine), baby I’m yours (I’m yours)
And nothing’s gonna ever (never), never, ever (never ever)
Ever come between us

[Chorus]
I’m yours (I’m yours) and you are mine (you're mine)
You are mine (you're mine), and I’m yours (I’m yours)
And nothing’s gonna ever (never), no no never (never ever)
Ever come between us

[Verse]
I'm so glad I found you
Let me put my arms around you
Whenever you are near
Oh there's a Heaven on Earth right here

[Chorus]
I’m yours (I’m yours) and you are mine (you're mine)
You are mine (you're mine), and I’m yours (I’m yours)
And nothing’s gonna ever (never), no, no, never (never ever)
Ever come between us

[Verse]
Hey baby, I'm so glad I found you
Let me put my arms all around you
Whenever you're near
I said a Heaven's on Earth right here

[Chorus + Fade out]
I’m yours (I’m yours) and you are mine (you're mine)
Oh baby (you're mine), and I’m yours (I’m yours)
And nothing’s gonna ever, no baby
Oh ever come between us
Said I (never) no nothing (never ever)
Will ever come between us
Said (never) no baby (never ever)
Between us
All because I'm yours, and you are mine
I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not be happy
This is what you want
So I conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine
So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was
Ha, I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear, here it is
Here, my dear, here it is
[Verse 1: Marvin]
Every day there's something new (oooh baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (oooooh honey)
And with every passing minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Bridge: Tammi]
And I, I've got a song to sing (ooooh, love)
Telling the world about the joy you bring (Oooooh, sweet love)
And you gave me a reason for living (Ooooh, honey)
And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of giving

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Verse 2: Marvin and Tammi]
To find a love like ours is rare these days
Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return (oooooh, baby)
Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn (Ooooh, love)
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation (Ooooh, sweetheart)
Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

[Chorus: Both]
Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

[Chorus: Both]
Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
[Intro]
Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling

[Verse 1]
Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another
Wholy holy
We should believe in one another
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in, in it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Wholy
Oh Lord, we can conquer hate forever, we need him
Wholy
We can rock the world's foundation
Everybody together, together and holy
Will holler love, love, love across the nation

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Wholy holy
All together and holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh, oh, ooo
Whoa, I was a fool from the start
Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean
Oh but you didn't know that, I didn't know that
You didn't know what I mean

You know you had a brother who thought he was cool
But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
And stay beside me night and day
You said you would love and obey
Well you should, well you should
It can only get you good

I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
But I'll never get enough get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again

You always knew that I
Wasn't that kind of guy
All the times I thought you knew
Well I was busy loving you
What was you afraid to lose
Everybody's got to choose
I don't know if I'm gonna get a yea or nay
Or if I'm gonna do what his honor says

(Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous
Too possessive, jealous
She was too possessive, jealous)

But if I decide, baby, what you want
I wanna know
If you would be satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Baby, satisfied
Would you be satisfied
Satisfied

Is that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy
Is that enough
You know I do it
And I know that you just love
That expensive stuff
You got a flair for style
And the style is all the while
What could I do
The judge said she got to keep on living
The way she accustomed to
She trying to break a man
I don't understand
Somebody tell me please, tell me please
Why do I have to pay attorney fees (My baby's)
Attorney fees (Ooh baby)
This is a joke
I need a smoke
Wait a minute
[Chorus 1]
Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
Because I've known you

[Verse 1]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, darling, have felt their world stand still?

[Chorus 2]
Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will

[Chorus 1]
If I should die tonight, love
Darling, far before my time
I won't die blue
Because I've known you

[Bridge]
Ooh, I'm so grateful baby
Grateful that you're loving me
My desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here, and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful
[Verse 2]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling, have felt their world stand still?
Oh Lord

[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Verse 1]
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion

[Chorus 2]
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

[Chorus 1]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Verse 2]
I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby

[Chorus 1]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

[Bridge]
You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

[Chorus 2]
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

[Chorus 1]
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
[Verse 1]
Listen everybody, especially you girls
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
But I believe, I believe
That a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside
To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody

[Verse 2]
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossing in my sleep
Because I haven't seen my baby all week

[Chorus 2]
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm going to stick by her until the very end
But she causes so much misery I forget how
Love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody

[Bridge]
Everybody knows, especially you girls
Love can be sad
But I have a love that's twice as bad

[Chorus 2]
Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah

[Chorus 1]
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
I want a witness
[?] [?]
[Verse 1]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger  (stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?
[Intro]
Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
I nearly went out of my mind
I miss your loving when you left, baby you did

[Verse 1]
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby your letters told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt a long time ago
Ah come, baby, and get to this

[Verse 2]
Ooh, remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I can’t wait, baby
I'm ready for you to start doing the things
I’m trying to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I can’t wait
Come here, come here, baby, get to this

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
To have you back, everything else will have to, to get back
Oh, nothing's changed, you're still sweet as morning rain
And I'm standing ready to
Love you, baby, make it good to you

[Bridge]
Ohhh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this

[Outro]
Girl, I know you've been gone a real long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you’re home, oh baby
[Verse 1]
Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh I miss you baby
Oh I miss you baby, oh I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby, but I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at
Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous, I don't mind a bit
Because you're still the greatest lay, even when you're miles away

[Verse 2]
Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up
[Verse 3]
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
And if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
Yeeeeah...
I gotta help the world
Yeeeeah...
Oh listen...

(mmmm) Someone is friendless, cannot find their way
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I want to be there, to help restore their faith
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Born of God's mercy
I'd be in their place
So I'll, keep my light in my window

I wanna ease the pain, (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace, mmm (their spirit needs)
Have been chosen for (a work to do)
To make this world a much better place
For me and you

(Some call me foolish) to lend a helping hand
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I feel so good when I help my fellow man
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Till love and mercy are spread throughout the land
So I'll, keep my light in my window

I wanna ease the pain, (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace, mmm (their spirit needs)
Have been chosen for (a work to do)
To make this world a much better place
For me and you

Whoooo
I've gotta help the world... mmmmmm

Ease the pain well (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace (their spirit needs)
Have been chosen for (oh a little work to do)
To make this world a better place
For me and you

Ease the pain yeah (that life can bring)
Help them find a peace (their spirit needs)

[Marvin Gaye]
Get your ass in gear
Come closer here
See your passion sweat
Now is it wet?
I'll jam you 'til you faint
You're no saint
I'll rock you 'til your sore
Like a whore
Forget that closet scene
I'm so mean
I'll throw you on the floor
Like before
You say it's not your thing
But still you come
You say you hate my guts
Still want some
You silly little freak
Tryin' to rise
The devil's strong in you
It's in your eyes
The thing that's deep in you
You can't resist
I'm gonna tie you up and have my wish
You do not understand but still you love
The way you worship it is all your thinking of
Everybody knows the thing you love
While you're on your knees
Raise your dress above..
Get down...
...Shut up
You nasty little slave, kiss my feet
Put your face right here and start to eat
Get down...
Shut up...
Get down...
Get up!
If you do it right, you get the pipe
And if you do it wrong, I'll spank you long
I love you, my masochistic beauty
I love you, I love your booty
I love it, my masochistic beauty... Yes
I love you, I love your booty
And it's my duty to spank your booty
And it my duty to spank your booty

[Gordon Banks using vocoder]
It's my duty
To spank your booty

[Marvin Gaye]
I love you
Got to learn
Shutup!
Get down
Get up
Get down
Get up
I know about your thing
You hate yourself
You selfish little bitch
You're in poor health
I'll use you till you moan
And cry so hard
Your guilt becomes your key
To turn to God
Although I am a part of this
Like you
I am a master man
With work to do
You must obey my will
Or face my rod
'Cause if you can't for me
You can't for God

Get down
Get up!
Get down
Get up!

Bitch, are you coming?
Get down

Deception is your game
You've been had
All your men are glad
And you are sad
Most of them were rich
But you are poor
Yet you take their cum
For nothing more
Seems that you're delighted
To fuck fate
You're looking for a way
To close the gate
The things you know you
Should you never do
Despite all the pain
It takes you through
My masochistic beauty
I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid

Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you

Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold, and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you

1964

Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you

1976

Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today
If you're a friend of mine

Cry cry cry-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free
Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free
[Intro]
Ooh Baby please turn yourself around
Ahh baby so I can love you
Ohh baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh sugar, just like you want me to

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 1]
Ohh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Ohh baby baby, don't ever go away
Ohh stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 2]
Ohh now, I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
That you're my foxy lady, foxy lady
[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

[Verse 3]
My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(On my mind there's[?])
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got to get ready

[Chorus]
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
This is Anna's song
Ah, making love all night long
Take a bath in milk, and lay on your satin sheets
Laugh and smile and(oh oh)
Lay a while and(oh oh)
Chocolate mint, candy sweets

(laying across the bed)
(laying across the bed, laying across the bed)
This is Anna's song
(this is Anna's song, this is Anna's song)
Keep on singing (loving my song)
All night long (loving my song)

Oooh work so hard, see me make a dollar
(never worked so hard)
I know I should for my own good
"What's it, husband, makes you so stubborn?"
And oh
Didn't you notice the snow, starting to fall
Come let us sit a while, just listen
To the children laughing and running wild

Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Yeah this is Anna's song - hey baby
Hey baby, loving you all night long
Let it happen again and again and again baby and again
She's a child of the sun, lovingest one of all
Mmm and this is Anna's song yeah
Keep on loving me baby loving me 'cross the hall
She can't do no wrong 'cause this is Anna's song
Laugh and shed a tear, kiss me, Anna dear
Ooohhhh baby

Hey Anna, here's your song yeah
The one that i promise baby, promise you all along
I knew all the time that I'd find the rhyme
Never have a fear, here it is, my dear
[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me

[Chorus]
So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands

[Chorus]

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
[Bridge] [Marvin Gaye w/ The Originals]
Ahh yeah - (I did the best I could)
Ahh yeah - (Nobody understood)
Nobody, nobody - (I did the best I could)
Goodnight, darling - (Nobody understood)
Take me away, take me away tonight - (I did the best I could)
I'm so... - (Nobody understood)
Nobody - (I did the best I could)
Lady luck shows my love me
Oh, when she blessed me with your loving charms
I've found my place in the sun
With heaven right here in your arms

I feel so lucky, so lucky baby
Oh, lucky to be loved by you
And I wanna thank you, thank you baby
For all the little loving things you do

I got to tell the world about it
I've got to stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me

Ooh baby, ooh baby

I don't mind stormy weather
The rain no longer makes me blue
And I don't care when my friends all get together
And leave me out of everything they do

It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway
Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby

In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away

I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me

I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me
[Intro]
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby

[Verse 1]
I want you, ooh

And you want me
So why can't we
Get together after the dance

[Verse 2]
All right, ooh

When I first saw you
(Looking good on Soul Train)
You were looking so, so good
(Oh, I was looking, too)
Oh, I was looking at you
(Sweet and so fine)
Sweet and so fine
(Freak that she was)
What a freak thing
(Tantalizing)

[Verse 3]
And I thought to myself
(Ooh, on the floor)
She was so into her space
(She started to dance, would she)
So caught up in the time and the place
And I wondered would she want me
(Ah, wonder if she, she'd go for me)
If she knows what she needs is me

[Verse 4]
Oh, yeah
(Talk while we play records, girl)
We could play so, so sweet
(Look so fine, move next to me)
Come on over. Baby, move closer to me
(Your brown eyes, love for a while)
I love your smile, stay a while
Oh, Baby (I just got flashes)
I feel something (That you're wanting me)
Something in me

[Verse 5]
Oh, nobody else, girl
They'll be talking all night
(Can we leave sweet love. Baby)
Why did the morning come so soon
Love don't need time (Girl)
To make up its mind
(Satisfy) That's how I feel
(All the love inside of me. Baby)
How could you, Baby
(What you going to do)
[Chorus]
Baby, please stay
Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away
Don't go away

[Verse 1]
I'm asking you, darling
Please stay, please stay, please
Don't go away, baby
Please stay baby, please
Don't go away, no
I couldn't stand it, darling
I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without you beside me darling, darling anymore
No sugar, no I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby, baby, baby, like I was before
Oh, baby
I'll just lie tossing and turning, baby, baby, baby
(Tossing and turning, tossing and turning)
All night long scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up I might find you gone

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
For I never felt this way before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh I never felt so good, honey before
Oh I never felt so good, oh before
Oh sugar, cause you dig it, you got it
Oh I never felt so good
Oh I love you, I just love you

[Outro]
Oh now I never felt so good before

Oh now I never felt so good before
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh
I never could come this way before, baby oh oh

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

[Verse 2]
We all talk about kindness

Brother turn on sister in this cruel, cruel world
That's what's wrong with, oh, with this world today

[Chorus]
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, oh
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants somebody to play with 'em
Wanna to mold you, wanna mold you

[Bridge]
We should all love each other

Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe....
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right
Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, oh anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick
Children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel
I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Anger
Anger
Say...
Can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes &amp; bright stars
Through the perilous fight, oh Lord
Oh, the fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so galantly, yeah
Streaming
&amp; the rockets red glare!
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof
Through the night
That our flag
Was still there
Oh, say
Does thy star-spangled banner
Yet wave
For the land
Of the free!
&amp; the home
Of the...
Home of the brave
Oh, Lord
Whooo!
[Verse 1]
Just like a clock without hands
There'd be no tick tock
Just like a house without a door
There'd be no need to knock
Just like a pen with no ink
It cannot write
But if you come back to me everything would be all right

[Verse 2]
Just like a candle with no flame
It will not burn
Just like children without books
They cannot learn
Just like a lamp without a switch
It cannot light
But if you come back to me everything would be all right

[Bridge]
I tried to please you, honey
To the greatest satisfaction
But no no, no no, baby
You wanted another attraction
Now please tell me
How can I go on without you?
Honey, How can my life go on without you
Darling, you better come back to me
Oh, let you end my misery
Listen
[Outro]
Oh, just like a clock without hands
There'd be no tick tock
Just like a house without a door
There'd be no need to knock
Darling, Just like a pen with no ink
It cannot write
But if you come back to me everything would be all right
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Honey, just like a candle with no flame
It will not burn
Just like children without books
They cannot learn
Just like a lamp without a switch
It cannot light
But if you come back to me everything would be all right
[Verse 1]
By the look in your eye
I can tell you're going to cry
Is it over me?
If it is
Save your tears for I'm not worth it, you see

[Chorus]
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
I'm telling you that's my home

[Verse 2]
You had romance
Did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so
I'd like for you to know that I'm not worth it, you see

[Chorus]
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Mhm, wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
Mhm, that's my home

[Bridge]
Oh, you keep telling me
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?

For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go

[Chorus]
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam?
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat
Oh oh, that's my home
Mhm, yeah
That's my home and I like it that way
Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And, ooh, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love

To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration

Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love
[Intro]
This is the story of two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance they met at the neighborhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again
He said, "How much have you missed me since I had you?"

[Verse 1]
How much. (Too much, many too much)
How much. (Too much, many too much)
Ooh I really wondered, girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How could say wait to me darling
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you baby
Ah sugar, come on give me a break
Because it's been so hard since I had you baby

[Verse 2]
My eyes must look serious
Because when I look at you I get delirious
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

[Bridge]
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby
[Verse 3]
Big Daddy Rucker is show nuff playing
Ahhh, this is a mellow dance
Oh, baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you?
Come on, let this be the last dance

[Outro]
Since I had you girl I have wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey there hasn't been no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
Since I taste you loving I haven't seen no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
[Verse 1]
Well, I'd be doggone if I wouldn't work all day
And I'd be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Verse 2]
Now hey, hey, hey!
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey hey hey! I'd be long gone
Oh I wouldn't be doggone, baby
I'd be long gone

[Bridge]
Now did you hear me?
Well now what I say, oh, believe me
Well, every woman should try to be
Whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you
Is for you to be true to me

[Verse 3]
I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend
Oh, baby, And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good

[Chorus]
Then I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone
Well I wouldn't be doggone
I'd be long gone

[Outro]
I wouldn't be doggone
Gone catch me a train
No baby, I wouldn't be
[Intro]
Yeah, want to talk, okay
Talk about getting it on
Early morning, should talk about getting it on

[Verse 1]
You want to have, some good loving
And plenty good time
Don't just talk about it
Everybody starts getting it on

[Verse 2]
Would you rather make love children?
As opposed to war, like you know you should
Don't you want to love somebody, think about the people
Makes you feel so good, yeah come on
Don't you want somebody
Think about the good life
You got the good decision
Come on just bring it on now
What you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Oh, Jesus, trying to tell the people
To come on and get it on, yes Lord
Ooh, get it on, oh no the nightmare
Come on, oh Lord get it on right now
Come on, you won't be so lonesome, you get it on
Get it on, lonesome body to get it
[Verse]
You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darling
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all my money
And that's why you're my pride and joy
And I'm telling the world
You're my (Pride and joy) pride and joy (Pride and joy)

And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town (Whole town)
And that's why (That's why)
I believe you're my (You're my) pride and joy (Pride and joy)

[Outro]

And I love you like a baby loves his toy (Pride and joy)
[Verse 1]
Symphony
She's only known as symphony
Melody, yeah
Crept- crept into the soul of me
Symphony, yeah
She's sort of like a song, she moves along
In perfect rhyme, oh la la
Right now feel perfect time, baby
You and me to slip away, slip away
Let our song begin to play
Yeah baby

[Verse 2]
Make me the one darling
Only one who know the bliss
Of knowing when to kiss

It starts to swell, then I can tell
That pretty soon we going to be in tune
Our hearts will be in perfect harmony

[Verse 4]
Symphony
Got my heart hit like a tender beat, "boom Boom"
When you want me, send for me, "cha cha"
And I'll come and love you tenderly

Symphony, symphony, oh
Do the thing makes you feel that I love you darling
[Intro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh
Ahh, ohh-ohh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance with you

[Verse]
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
I've been waiting all night
For the song to be right
Now they've turned down the lights
Hey, darling
May I have this dance?
Oh, baby
And there's how you feel
My love is real
For you, oh, baby
May I have-
Hey, baby
Dance with me
And maybe you'll see
What I feel is really real
For you
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
This is my last chance
To get close to you
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Oh, baby
I'm just a shy guy
I'm so nervous
Girl, but I got to try
Girl, please, take my hand
Dance with me, baby
Please dance real close to me
Oh, baby, yeah

[Outro]
Can I go with you, baby?
Oh, oh
Hey
Don't leave me here
Feelin' this way
Oh, ohh
Oh, baby, baby
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In this life... of... happiness and sadness (Alright)
When you've lost... out on love... (I know)
And it all... ends up in madness (Play that horn)
And you say, "Love, please go away. Don't torture me night and day."
Then something that's real... Someone you feel comes in

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody who says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again... Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...
She's so wonderful
I tried not to let my heart step in
But what to do, baby
What could I do
When somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again
Falling in love again
Falling in love

The world's so great, baby
So love me
As though there was no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow
So let's have a toast and whisper
See you later
I love you
I love you, baby
I love you

Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
Let's live, not regret it
I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear, hear the laughter
Of children playing in the snow
To kiss my baby, under the mistletoe

But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell
Hoping my family is well
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home
In time for the Christmas tree

Listen, oh yeah, ooo
I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Ooo, I want to hear jingle bells ring
Want to hear jingle bells ringing
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight

Ooo, ooo, ooo
If I can't make it home in time
I know you'll be keeping my spirit bright
By wearing my name and trying to stop this fight
Ah, but I'd give anything to see you the family
And that little Christmas tree

Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Oh, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Yes, I want to hear jingle bells ringing
Ooo, I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon

Let's get it on
Ah, baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we've got to be here
Let's live
I love you

There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
C'mon, baby
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on
Let's get it on, baby
This minute, oh yeah
Let's get it on
Please, let's get it on

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, darlin'
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Oh, gonna get it on
Threaten' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves ya
Let me groove ya good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on

C'mon, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified
Girl, you give me good feeling
I've been sanctified
[Intro]
Ah-ah-aaah, oh yeah
Oh listen to me people

[Verse 1]
I haven't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I haven't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow

[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Verse 2]
Said, I haven't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's going to last
And I haven't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class
Telling you I'm just a fellow
Said I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time
[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Verse 3]
The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell you
I got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time

[Chorus]
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I haven't got time for nothing else

[Outro]
(Yeah, she's never hard to find
Because she's always on my mind)
[Verse 1]
Well, you been talkin’, talkin’ to the people
Tryin’ to get them to go your way
Telling us, telling us not to worry
You say we won’t be led astray
We’re so tired of your signifying
How do we know, 'til it’s too late
Whether or not you’ve been lying?
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe, sir, that humanity’s at stake
You see, busin’, busin’ is just one issue, one issue
What about the rest of it, mister?

[Chorus]
Well, if you've got the plan
I said, you, if you’ve got the master plan
I got to vote for you, ah yeah
I got to vote for you
‘Cause you’re the man, I know, ah yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe what this country needs is a lady for president
No, we don’t wanna hear no more lies
About how you plan to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
This heavy taxation has got us all in this awful situation
Now, don’t, don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind
Oh, economics, money is all you’re interested in
Do you have a plan that all the people can share in?
[Chorus]
‘Cause if you’ve got the plan
I got to vote for you
Cause you’re the man, I know, oh

[Verse 3]
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say?
Because the tables might turn against you
Set around Election Day
Demagogues and admitted minority haters
Should never be President, this time a lady
Will you, will you stop the bombs
And right all the wrongs this administration has done?
I know peace and freedom is the issue, oh Lord
Do you have a plan with you, mister?

[Chorus]
‘Cause if you’ve got the plan
I said, you, you’ve got the master plan
Well I got to vote for you
Oh Lord, I got to vote for you
‘Cause you’re the man
Woo, got to vote for you
If you’re gonna take a stand
I got to vote for you
Gonna be the man?
[Outro]
What about the issues?
What about the young folks?
What about marijuana?
What about peace, peace in the land?
Do you understand?
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take a stand
Then I’ll vote for you, I think you’re the man
Tell me something, don’t run away
Tell me something, gonna see your face
I gotta vote for you, I think that you’re the man
Gotta be strong whether you’re right or wrong
This is a story about life
Mostly about my life and oooh people I
Wanna share it with you
Is there someway I can help someone
Maybe someone is lost and needs to see the light, oh listen people
I have a story, a life's opera

Get down, we never said we couldn't get down
Loving us be at it make it fun sometime X2

Oh babe this is a song about life oooh baby and we could only sing oh that song
For all those who feel they wanna know
They wanna know the way oh babe
Listen to the truth, listen to the wind
You see Jesus, hallelujah and Jehovah
Martin and Malcolm and all men who ruled the world
Who did die for you

Listen, listen understanding, and I m sure the truth in
Listen and see
Something you like better than you
Ever expected to be, call on the Lord
Oh (Get down never said we couldn't get down) the Lord will take care of things the better than I've seen (Get down never said we couldn't get down)
Listen my brother listen my sisters (Get down never said we couldn't get down) oh love the lord...

The devil trying to do his work
To make you feel like its righteous
Through his justification oh but you gotta look through and see the light now
You can't make wrong to right your own
You see there got to be two sides in all the bounds oh yes it is
Stood up on the line and choose your side.Maybe it'll take you a little longer and understanding to life oh but I believe(I believe yes I believe)I believe all dreams come true (I believe yes I believe)
Maybe one day you'll then realize oooh
(Marching)then we'll keep on marching
Keep on marching, marching, marching, marching. Marching, moving, moving, keep on moving, moving, moving
Moving oh people you know people
Keep on marching closer closer to God you'll see

Our father which art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
Come thy will be done oh Father on earth as it is heaven
Give us this day Jesus our daily bread
Oh Father forgive us all death sentence we forgive our death times
Lead us not to temptation Jesus
But deliver us from evil oh Father
Light the Kingdom the prophet
Lord Jesus forever and ever amen
Mmmmmm oh Father
[Chorus]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight
(To hold you tight)
But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight
(Out of sight)
Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Chorus]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
I'm going to love you
(Going to love you in every way)
In every way
(Going to love you in every way)
I'm going to love you
(Going to love you in every way)
In every way
(Going to love you in every way)
[Verse 2]
With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day
(I'll stay by your side)
Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain
(Don't you listen to that jive)
Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you

[Outro]
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Time...Time...
Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
Time...Time...Time...Time
But we have to live right to get the time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Time...Time...Time...Time
Please, Time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
I let temptation get me off of my groove
Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind, yeah
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
Pretty good lovin', oh
Get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right - good lovin', oh
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right - good love
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right, baby
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
(Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock -
My life's a clock and it's winding down)

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground

I've been racing against time
Trying my best to find my way
Change our world in just one day
Blowin' coke all up my nose
Gettin' in and out my clothes
Foolin' 'round with midnight hoes
But that chapter of life's closed

From the day you're born
Till the day you're in the ground
I wanna be where you are
I got to be where you are
I want to be where you are
I got to be where you are

Good night, y'all
Good night, little Frankie, Nona.
Night, little Marvin
I love you all
I'll always love you, Janis

I want to be where you are
Ah, I've got to be where you are, baby
Oh, my children, I'll always be where you are
[Verse 1]
Oh you, you I see in my mirror in the morning
Instead of seeing me I see you, I see your face
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Though it's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby (You know, you know, you know I need you babe)

[Verse 2]
Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a hard-working boy
Oh you've given your love to me (You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feeling in our hearts
We meet in shadows (We meet in shadows)
Your friends must never know (Your friends must never know)
That we are lovers, darling (That we are lovers)
Although it hurts me so (Although it hurts me so)
For your sake no one must see
The precious of love you're giving me
But you know, I need you baby (You know, you know, you know, I need you)
(You, you, you, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you, you, you)

[Verse 3]
Oh, one day I'll make the grade, my lucky star will shine
I will tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go (Till then we must go)
The way we have before (The way we have before)
And never let it show (And never let it show)
We love each other so (We love each other so)
Our love's a one-way track because there's no turning back
Oh I need you baby
(You know, you know, you know I need you babe)

[Outro]
You, you I see in my mirror in the morning (You, you, you, you, you, you)
Instead of seeing me (You, you, you, you, you, you)
I see you, I see your face (You, you, you, you, you, you)
[Verse]
Dreams of you my darling still
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart
Oh I miss you, miss you with all my heart
Oh baby, what else can I say
Put on three albums
And let's fly baby
I've got to know
How much I love you so
I'm going to make you feel
That my love is strong for you tonight
Baby, I'm going to make it right
Put three albums on baby
We're going to make it long, long, long
Now when the music starts
I'm going to groove you slow and quiet
And when the first side's through
I'll still be into you
I'm getting sober
Let's get high and turn the record over
'Cos baby it's time for phase two, yeah
That's how it is, yeah
That's how it goes, hey
Just why it is, yeah
Nobody knows
'Cos music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Oh and my anatomy
It's my symphony, always stay with me
You know that the world ain't right
Baby, lots of people stay uptight
I'll go crazy
If something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
The second jam, girl is falling down
We've been one hour, still I got the power
Turn up the sound
Sounds drown out the screams
Come rock with me
Straight into Side B
The time has passed
An hour and a half
I love you baby
I'm strong enough to last
You, you and your music
Are more precious than gold baby
Two albums later baby
And I'm feeling great
You said wait, let's take a break
Before you play the last side
Are you fit enough to ride
I said yes, baby
Just let me catch my breath
Honey, honey, honey
Oh baby, I'm not through yet
This is one night honey, that you won't forget
I love you darling, I'm going to prove it tonight
Put on some music
Turn on some music
I've got some music
[Verse 1]
Oh, oh, oh
Day in, day out
Sidewalk sleepers turn about
Day by day, the work gets done
Day by day, another war goes on

[Chorus]
Tell me, where are we going?
Oh oh, what's the future showin'?
Oh, where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on, where are we gettin'?

[Verse 2]
Day in, day out
A little boy and girl are goin' out
Day by day, baby's babies are born
Day by day, people say, "Right on"

[Chorus]
Tell me, where are we going'?
Oh oh, what's the future showin'?
Oh, where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on where are we gettin'?

[Bridge]
All we need
All we need
All we need
All we need
All we need, oh
[Verse 3]
Day in, day out
It gets better, the people shout
Day by day flames get higher
Lives and pains, yeah, they fuel the fire

[Chorus]
Oh, where are we going?
Oh oh, what's the future showin'?
Where are we headed?
With all that's goin' on, where are we gettin'?

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Where are we going?)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Where are we going?)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Where are we going?)
With all that's goin' on, where are we headin'?
Day by day, baby (Where are we going?)
By day (Where are we going?)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (Where are we going?)
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
(Where are we going?)
(Where are we going?)
(Where are we going?)
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo (Where are we going?)
Oh oh oh, da-da-da-da (Where are we going?)
(Where are we going?)
[Verse 1]
Ah baby
After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
You're left alone and broken-hearted
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's going to last nobody knows

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, sugar
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is my love

[Verse 2]
Yeah now
I know you're walking down a lonesome road
And your heart is carrying a heavy load
I know you feel like you haven't got a friend (Haven't got a friend)
And your whole world's caving in (Caving in)
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (To be strong)
You better forget him now that he's gone (Now that he's gone)
And remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is my love
Ooh baby

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Listen to me, little darling
The road of love is rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're going through
You wish that you were never born
You better forget him now that he's gone
Just remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, honey, yeah
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is

[Verse 4]
Wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
See those flowers, they need love
See the bluebirds, they need love
See the babies, they need love
All God's children, oh need love

See your mother, she needs love
And my father, he needs love
That's true baby, and I need love too

See those rain drop, rivers they need love
And the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
Don't find good love every day, we ought to think
Before we throw good love away

Doesn't matter, what you are
A thief or a beggar or even a superstar
As long as you were made by God above
Oh, I know, I know, you need love, we need love

Baby, oh, I need love, I need your love
(I'm standing here), oh baby standing in the need of love, I need love
I need it, I got to have it baby
Oh can't you see that I'm standing in the need

I'm still here cause I need love
I'm still with you dear
Cause I need your love
And I know, oh yes I know
Though you feel you don't need loving
You still need loving too, oh yes you do

It don't matter no, it doesn't matter what you are
A thief or a beggar or a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know
You were made for love (cause love is what you need and understanding) oh, understanding

You were made for love
Sweet understanding why can't we see we were made for love
You were made for love baby, sweet understanding
Why can't we see, we (you) were made for love
(why is it so hard for us today to see the real)
We were made from love, you were made of love baby you were made to love baby

What's the only thing that's gonna get us together
(love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright)
What is this we're singing about?
For the love of Jesus, let's do it!

I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love

It's a fact
(who) even the slightest thing needs love
(who) all of the folks in jail need love
(who) even a mean old man needs love
Why can't you understand that I need love?
I used to hear a sparrow singing, baby
Oh, but one day as I went along I didn't hear his song
But I know the sparrow should sing
Sing on such a morning in spring
Oh sparrow, why don't you sing?

Sing to me, oh, sparrow come around
Come around, why don't you come around?
Sing about melody, aww, melody
About the things you see
Anything you want to sing about
Just sing it on out now, sing it on out

Let the world know what life's all about
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Oh sing, little sparrow, won't you sing for me?

And for the rest of all my world
They'll appreciate it, I know
Every time I'm feeling low
I know I can always count on you
Sing, little sparrow
About the troubles you're in, places you've been
You can sing I know it, don't you try to pretend

Sing while you're here, sing a song, my dear
Let me hear your song, do you mean to call
Sing, little sparrow, sing
Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song

Sing to me, let me hear your agony
Did you say, "Man's sucking up the land?"
Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God above
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing

Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow
Oh, little sparrow, sing

Sing to me of jealousy
Aww, sing what that's all about
Sing it all out, shout, little sparrow
Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow

Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know
You sweet, itty, bitty, pretty bird
Sing before you go
Sing to me, Marvin Gaye before you fly away
Never stop singing sparrow till we hear your song

Sing your song
Sing your song
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and
I remember a bird
I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free

Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly

Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
But after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife

Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime

Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going down

That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you loved me
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah

I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it

You tried to have them shackle me
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge

You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand
I love you
I love you
(Woah, I love you)
And I need you baby (and you need me too)

So no matter where your love goes
And though she doesn't care
(She knows I'm there)
'Cause I know how much my baby needs me
Share me
(Oh believe, ah sugar)

(But she needs me)
Ooh my sugar
I guess it isn't very smart of me
Following you, tagging along
But right or wrong
I'll take care of you, I'm here
I'm with you baby

Forever I will be your friend
Or your lover
Because my one ambition is
To (wake up)
Oh wake up
And make her discover

She needs me (3x)
So I will go where she leads me
And I'll always be there
Tend to your every care
Long as she needs
Needs me

Ooh my sugar, oh my sugar
Oh, oh
How can love get up and hold a party, yeah
Don't wanna sing a song, get up and party
Baby, come on, just come on, girl, and I'll hold a party
Get up and dance and sing, I'm gonna hook you
Baby, you know I've got a yen to love you

Party with your heart and your soul is honkin' 'round and
Oh, baby, you know that you're mine, so won't you come on just
Party down so much, it's in your heart that-ooh, girl, hey
Jammin' with all your love, honey, honey
You know that your love's all mine, a party
Baby, baby, hey, come on get up and...
Girl, don't you know that it's alright - whoo!
Party on down

[ad-libs]

Hey!
Girl, I'm gone, I'm gone, my... oh no, baby, won't be for long
Hey, oh you know, what it is, you know those are the reasons
Oh...

[Repeat first part to fade]
[Verse 1]
So let me tell you 'bout last Saturday night, the club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies?
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress?
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake ya titties
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing

[Bridge]
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You make me rock, you make me rock
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You turn me on, the way you dance, the way you dance
Midnight lady, sexy dancer
Hot and hardy, love to party
Check it out


[Verse 2]
We're jamming to love
Major love, minor love
Jamming to a great crescendo
Let's party baby, shake it, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on
When I saw you, I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop, I got the rhythm
I got the rhythm
Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

[Bridge]
Midnight lady, midnight lady
Rocking and finger popping
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak baby
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
We got to rock, we got the rhythm
We got to come on down to the boogie
Feeling good

[Outro]
Check that classy rhythm
Give me that sexy beat
I dig that feeling jam
Midnight lady, sexy
You are the one I'm looking for
I never, never, never knew before
Oh, baby, you're looking too good
Super freaky
Life's a nightmare and I can't stand it

Since you turned me lose

Thinking love would pull me through

Honey honey now my love starving heart is killing me

Darling since I lost you

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

Wanting you more than before

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

Don't turn me from your door

Thinking love would pull me through

Honey honey now my love starving heart is killing me

Honey since I lost you

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

Wanting you more than before

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

Don't turn me from your door

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

I seen you deal better dimes

Love starved heart of mine, killing me

Have pity on this heart of mine
I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss but more than this
I wish you love

And in July, lemonade
To cool you in some leafy place
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love

My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love

Well, my breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never, never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free

I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love
[Intro]
This is sweet sorrow
Living for tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Oh, I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have faded a long
A real long time ago, yeah yeah yeah, ah baby
Oh, oh, I wish I didn't need your kiss
Tell me, why must your kiss torture me and drive me crazy this?
Do it, baby

[Bridge]
I (I'm gon' find somebody) should be smilin' by now
With some new, new, fine, tender friend
Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend, on the mend

[Verse 2]
When I try, oh yeah, oh, oh
Something in my heart says "No," oh, oh
I can't get you out of my head
I've still got to depend on you
Oh, and I wish, I really wish I didn't love you so
Oh, don't you know, baby?
[Outro]
Now, I wish, I wish, I wish, oh baby
Girl, I wish, I wish, I wish, oh baby
I didn't love you so much
[Verse 1]
Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
I saw a heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet girl, who had a gentle way
Cute little way that caught me in its glowing spell

[Verse 2]
Why did I want you? What could you offer me?
Just a love to last my lifetime through?
And when I lost my heart so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly, oh girl, to you

[Outro]
If I had to choose again, I would still choose you
[Intro]
Let your conscience be your guide
Let your conscience be your guide, oh baby

If you want to leave me, go on girl
Go on and leave, oh leave me
But oh darling, oh darling, oh yeah

If only you could remember just hard I tried
Please, oh please, don't forget
I've given you the best years of my life

[Chorus]

You need someone to call your own

[Chorus]

Having fun
[Intro]
Oh, oh, baby, oh, oh

[Verse]
Suddenly a stranger entered my life
Like I pictured her to be
Started my emotions running free
Oh, just like the waters in the sea

[Bridge]
As she looked at me with a smile so sincere
My heart started to sing in a voice, I'm sure she could hear
I reached out for a tender loving kiss
Only to find my love didn't even exist, oh baby
I then realized it was just a dream
The candlelight's burning such a radiant beam
Oh how I yearned for this dream to come true
For just one exciting moment with someone like you
But as I sat there with tears falling from my eyes
I seemed to dream a thousand and one sighs
Yeah, hope was passing by with a slow unhappy pace
And all there was for me was the bitterest taste, oh baby
Stranger in my life, surely it was
Stranger in my life, oh baby

[Outro]
But as I sat there, tears falling from my eyes
The stranger in my life reached out
Honey, reached out for me
And opened my world of loneliness with a magical kiss, oh baby
Stranger in my life, tell you she's so fine
Stranger in my life, she's wonderful
Stranger in my life, telling you she's fine
Stranger in my life, I know she's wonderful
[Verse 1]
Talkin', talkin' to the people
Try, get them to go your way
Tellin' lies, not to worry
That we won't be led astray
So blind, unsignified
Your opponents always lying
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe America's at stake

[Chorus]
You know, busin', busin' is the issue
Do you have a plan wager? Woo
If, if you have a plan, ah
If you have a master plan
I got to, got to vote for you
Hey, hey, got to vote for you
You're the man, woo
(You're the man, you're the man)
Woo (You're the man, you're the man)

[Verse 2]
We don't wanna hear no more lies
About how you planned a compromise
We want our dollar value increased
That employment to, to rise
The nation's taxation
Is causin' all, all of this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Turn around, rob the people blind
[Chorus]
Economics is the issue
Do you have a plan wager?
'Cause if you've got a master plan
Got to vote for you
You're the man

[Bridge]
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land (Woo)

[Verse 3]
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say
Because the tables just might turn against you, brother
Set around Election Day
Politics and hypocrites
Is turning us all into lunatics
Can you take the guns from our sons?
Right all the wrong this administration's done?
[Chorus]
Peace and freedom is the issue, oh
Do you have a plan wager?
'Cause if you've got the plan, if you've got the master plan
I got to vote for you, hey, hey, got to vote for you
'Cause you're the man

[Outro]
Vote for you (Hey, you're the man)
Got to vote for you (I got to vote for you)
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you (Woo)
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
Softly they fall, where do they go?

(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(gentle snowflakes)
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
(it's so thrilling)
Blankets of white, brighten the night
(such a feeling)
They seem to say, that our love is

Here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer

Flowers bloom

Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(tootsies toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the
Gloom
I will always remember this night
Here with you
There snowflakes, pretty purple

Snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple

Snowflakes
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
(chestnuts roasting)
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
(tempters toasting)
Drifting on air, without a care
(purple snowflakes)
Cover the ground, without a sound
(love the snowflakes)
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the
Gloom
I will always remember this night

Here with you
And I say snowflakes, pretty purple

Snowflakes
I'll always Remember the snowflakes
And you baby, and you
Snowflakes are falling, falling
Falling..
And I got you in my arms
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, when you and me lived in infinity
There were two of us, a God of love and a God of evil
Something about polarity - you know, day and night
Black and white, hot and cold, wrong and right, life and death
Polarity, without the opposite we could never be
Now this is all-knowing entity of good and evil
Decided that the place was awfully lonely
So they decided that they would create a world
Of insects and flowers and animals and birds and life untold
Worlds within a world of good things for the good
And evil things for the evil, and there was jealousy

[Verse 2]
Now comes man
Devil wanted to have all the control
But the Good Lord said
"We gonna have to share equally in this here human soul
But we will give man understanding and reason to decide
Whether to join a God of love and peace
Or burn in your eternal fire"
Lord, have mercy and stay with me
Good God said, "I really, I really want to
Love 'em and give 'em all the things that they desire
And bless 'em and love 'em so much and
I got to give 'em reason 'cause I want 'em to come back to me
When the power of evil is all gone"
[Verse 3]
Whoa, some souls are ready to rejoin the Lord of love
Did you ever wonder why a little baby cry when he's born
His soul isn't happy 'cause we got to give up all the sin
But we coming a-home my friend until the soul is ready to be Spirit again
Good Lord don't mind, when you're ready He'll be ready
'Cause time don't mean a thing to these Lords
The Evil Lord don't mind if you're not ready
He wants you to bring your soul to him
It's a power struggle, my friend
A Buddhist monk can burn his body without a flinch
I think he's ready

[Verse 4]
The Evil Lord tempts a man with the things
Heart and the soul and the flesh
That you put on him and desire, to keep him from you:
"I don't think you shoulda did right, you give him too much power
I'll make him destroy all we created - weak and foolish, baby"
And the Good Lord said, "No, no, I know know know
Mankind can feel my love"
And the Evil Lord said
"No, no, no, no, no, no, I want 'em all
You shouldn't have gave him reason
You shouldn't have gave him reason"
'Cause we are the soul to the mind
And the mind to the brain and the brain to the body
Get what the soul desires
And Evil said
"I got what the soul desires for mankind's flesh
Having fun, and uh, I know what they like and
I'm gonna put it on 'em, baby
'Cause your body's really nothing now
But a safe for the soul"
[Outro]
And then the Good Lord says
"You can listen to me, I'm in your soul
Your decision is free
I gave you reason, don't you wanna be with me, do right?"
Walk in the light, I love, baby
Dreams of you, dreams of you
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart, baby
God has healed my heart
Used to go out looking for love
Now love is looking for me
And sweet music keeps me happy
Not so long ago, darling, I was feeling sad
Who would've kissed my lips
I would've still felt bad, ah baby
There were times I've wondered if I was insane
Ah baby, I simply let my tear drop fall like rain
Oh baby, but when I kiss your lips
The clouds begin to roll away
Uh, down to my finger tips
I feel the happiness each day
Oh, my Mama said to me
She told me, son love goes where you take it
So, stay with the spirit, boy
I feel that you gonna make it, yeah
Got me wondering, yeah
'Cause music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Music has never let me down
It's my symphony, always stayin' in me
Who'd know that the world ain't right, ah baby
Lots of people uptight
I'll go crazy if something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
Music makes the clouds roll by, baby
Your music kissed my tears and set my eyes
Your music makes me want to sing
Your music is a joy to bring
Music is my heart and soul
It's more precious than gold
You're like a song in my heart
I love every part
A song, you're like a song
Happiness today is just a song away, just a song
I love your music, baby
I don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh, turn on your music, baby
See my happiness beam
Your love is music
Oh my darling, yeah
Your love is music, ah baby, yeah
And music is my life
Turn on some music more
Hey, turn on some music more
I got my music, hey, hey
I love my music, hey
We need the music
I got my music, hey
I love the music, oh
Turn on some music
Get off the music, ah
Turn up the music
Let's have the music, ha
[Verse]
I have tasted success
I've been in love more or less
With a dream that will last me
A lifetime, baby
Other dreams, I have lost
But whatever the cost
The parade isn't passing me by
No, no, no, no, no, darling
So if the picture I paint
Makes me a sinner, or makes me a saint
I won't try, no, not I
To deny it, woo, oh
I may cry with the past
But it's easier to laugh about it
When I think of my wonderful life
I thank God for my wonderful life
[Chorus 1]
Maybe there'll come a time when I won't be sad and lonely

[Verse 1]
Just suppose I could love you from the very start, maybe
Heaven knows I could show you with an open heart, baby
You're the one that I've been waiting for
In this loneliness forever more

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I know you're the one for me

[Verse 2]
Can it be that you're needing me as I need you, honey?
(promise me)
Promise me if we part and I never knew, funny
Deep inside my heart I hope and pray
That someday you'll come to me and say

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Love is strong and I'm betting that it will come my way, gladly
If I'm wrong and mistaken, then I'll have to pay, sadly
No other love could ever be the same
If we fail, there's just yourself to blame
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hear no trouble talk
People telling me what they seen you do
Girl, we got understanding and I don't wanna ruin it
If I wanna find something wrong, I'll go catch you doing it, woo

[Chorus]
You got what I need baby (Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
So I'm gon' give you respect and I want to protect
Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna act so naive
When people tell me you gon' deceive me
You're the only one who's brought me peace and joy
What we share, Lord knows, I ain't about to destroy

[Chorus]
Oh, baby (Sugar, sugar, now)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
So I'm gon' give you respect and I wanna protect
Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Sugar, sugar, now)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
[Bridge]
Sugar, you possess all the things I been searching for
You're the only one I worship and I adore
What you got, baby, so many fellas are trying to find
Not gonna fix it so some other guy can beat my time

[Chorus]
(Ooh, sugar, sugar, now)
I don't wanna lose you
(Don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna lose you)
So I'm gon' give you respect and I want to protect
Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh (Give you respect, wanna protect)
Little girl (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)

So I'm gon' give you respect and I want to protect
Our love (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You deserve it, baby (Give you respect, gotta protect)
This love of ours, yeah, yeah (This love of ours, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know, when you're in love and your lover leaves you
And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here
Sittin' home and thinkin', you say

Distant lover, lover
Oh, so many miles away
Oh, heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, oh lover
You should think about me, say a prayer for me
Please, please, baby
Think about me sometime, think about me yeah
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce
Oh, baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made of the daily letter
Then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window, sugar, down the lonesome road

Distant lover, oh, sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Don't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it like it was a precious jewel
Oh, baby

Lord, have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Something I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now, Lord
I wonder do you wanna hear me scream and plead
Please, please, please, come back home girl
Please, baby, come back home

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Oh, something I wanna say
When you left to go away
No other do I want, do you wanna have me plead and scream
Please, please, oh please, baby
Come back home, girl
Oh baby, come back
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
You are so wonderful
That being near you is all I'm living for
You show me more kindness in little ways
Than I've ever known in all my days
Tell me we'll stay together
Let me love you forever

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[From now on, backing vocals: "Wonderful one"]
In you there is a rare quality
Your love, baby, it means the world
For me you're always concerned
And you ask nothing, baby, in return

[Chorus 2]
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Chorus 3]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one
Sweetheart, you're a wonderful one

[Chorus 2]
You're really more than I deserve
From my heart I mean these words
You're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
But your love, you're always around
Words of confidence you speak to me
Baby, and you place a tender kiss on my cheek
It makes my burden a little bit lighter
It makes my life a little bit brighter

[Chorus 1]
'Cause you're a wonderful one
You're a wonderful one

[Chorus 3]
Oh you're a wonderful one
Baby, you're a wonderful one

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make her the sweetest girl that I've ever seen
Then give her two eyes like roses and clover
Then tell me that my lonesome nights are over

Ooh Sandman, I'm all alone
Ain't got nobody to call my own
So please turn on your magic beam
And Mr. Sandman, bring me please
Come on, and bring me a dream

(Sandman) ooh Sandman, (bring him a dream) I want a little baby
(Make her the cutest) girl (that he's ever seen) that I've ever seen now
(Give her two eyes) just like roses and clover
Then tell me that my lonesome nights are over

(Sandman) Oh Sandman, (he's all alone) I'm so sad
(Ain't got nobody) so lonely, (to call his own) nobody wants me
Please turn on your magic beam
And Mr., come on Mr. Sandman
Please save me, hurry and bring me a dream
Sandman, I've been waiting so long
So come on and bring me a dream
Oh Sandman, won't you bring me a dream?
I know the essence of your togetherness
Is so divine
Well, it sends an air of happiness to my soul
And my mind

I know the way your eyes caress me
The look of love on your face
Sends me to a new dimension
Keeps me spinning way out in space

Well, it's love, it's love, it's not my imagination
How else can I explain the phenomenon
What a sensation from this wonderful creation
Oh, baby, you're the music I hear

It's the sound of your voice
Darling, you're my rhapsody
My rhapsody

The essence of your togetherness
Really, really turns me on
Even in a crowd of people
You and me can really be alone

Oh, baby, we're so together, darling
If you only knew
I'd give my life for you
Oh, baby, it's love, it's love
It's not my imagination
How else can I explain the phenomenon
Of sensation from this wonderful creation?

You're the music I hear
It's the sound of your voice
You're my rhapsody
If you only knew
I'd give my life for you
[Chorus 1]
Oh, yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1]
Suddenly
People, I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly
Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say

[Chorus 2]
I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday

[Verse 2]
Oh, talking about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
If you let me girl
I'll be good to you
I will keep your tender body next to mine

Why don't you let me lady be good to you
I want to take care of you darlin'
All of your life and make love to you
If you let me baby Oh
I'll be good to you girl
Cause I love you darlin'
You're out of this World
Please make love with me


My love
Funk Me
Funk Me Funk Me
Funk Me
OOOh

I need us for me to love
Mother nature taught me love
We don't really have to freak
You just thrill me when you speak

I can see that you're a star
And I like the way you are
Funky music lights my fire
Shakes my body sexified
Since we both have lots of love
Send some lovin' up above
Don't give me no added vice
See the love that's in my eyes

All I know is how much I love you Baby
Woo
Aw baby you know that I love you girl
Darlin' I'd like to love you right now
Right now, forever more baby

Watching you over here dancin' on the floor
It makes me want to love you all the more, baby
For when we begin
I know my love for you
Will never never end

Why don't you give me a chance
To prove my romance
I don't know if I can go on without
Having you for my own

Oh father above
Give me this lady to love
So I can love her right now father
All of my love for you to share
Take you, baby, anywhere
I want to love you right now
Hey
Funk me if you got the desire
Funk me if you got the desire
[Repeats until end]
[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

[Verse 1]
Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on

[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart

[Verse 2]
My biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me
[Chorus]
Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart=

[Outro]
Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it
Look in your eyes
And I see the lies
But in my mind
It's a mystery
Feeling the pain
And I feel the love
And once again
You're the world to me

Hey, what is this thing I'm feeling, baby
What are these strange emotions
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply

It's almost midnight
And my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town

(Very special love
Very special love affair)
(Very special love
Very special love affair)

You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love and a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And my soul's on fire
Looking for love and a girl for me
Memories of our love obsesses me
Thoughts of us are sending all the time
If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine
Very, very loving day
Think of you every day, think of you all kinds of ways

Sometimes I hate your guts
And love your lust
Sometimes I love your guts
And hate your lust

It was a crazy love affair
A crazy love affair
Oh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I hate your lust

[Repeats]
Very special love
[Verse 1]
It's so hard loving you
But I don't wanna let you go

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 2]
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 3]
I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, make that sacrifice

[Verse 4]
Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Be your #1 fool, at any sacrifice

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)
[Chorus]
At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
I found a love for me

[Verse 1]
Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me

[Chorus
At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Do you believe me? At last
Oh, I found a love for me
(One more thing)

[Verse 2]
I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

[Chorus]
Ah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
At last, huh, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, yeah
[Bridge]
Whoo
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
Listen
She's sweet, so sweet
Lord, she's the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oh yeah, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

[Chorus]
At last
Ooh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, ah
I found a love for me
[Verse]
Ooh, walking in the rain is insane, can't explain
How I feel when I'm walking in the rain with you
It rains in my hair but I don't seem to care
Just as long as you're walking with me, too

[Bridge]
It rains as we walk
We get sunny weather
We stop and we talk
Then we get wet together
Rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you ever go

[Outro]
Oh, now rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes
How I'd cry, oh my darling
Should you, should you ever go
[Chorus]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Oh, life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love

[Verse 1]
I will return for all the years
Will rise, baby
I can't admit understanding
Why am I to blame
Nothing 'bout your business
See you on the way
Never been a witness
See me on the way
Oh, tell me what it is made you want to change your mind
Did you say "it's your fault you want to fight"?

[Background repeating]
Very special love
Very special love affair
[Chorus x2]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love

Yesterday, you said you still loved me
Still stringing my poor heart along, baby
But since I been without you
I can see all the things I done wrong
It's not your business
I don't need to know
I know what you're doing
Everywhere you go
I will not forget you
Long as the years pass, baby
Your love was fine, so satisfying
The pleasure was like pure gold, sugar
Now tell me will you forget it
And me filled with reverie
I look back with disassociation
At our history
The good times belong to those
Who really wish to enjoy, baby
I tell all the children
Ours was a love that fell
Oh, tell me what it really was
Made you want to change your life
As far as I can see
You had paradise, you had paradise

[Background repeating]
Very heavy love
Very heavy love affair

I put you on a pedestal
And said I worshiped you secretly, baby
I tried my best to change you
I'm going to admit my mistakes
Just like to the wind

[Chorus]
Life's a game of give and take
To prevent the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Life's a game of give and take
To suppress the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
Life's a game of give and take
To suppress the sure heartache
Life's a game of give and take
In love
[Intro]
Ooh (That special one)
Oh baby (You're that special one)

Ooh, do-do-do-do

[Chorus]
Special one
You are that special one
You're that special one
You are that special one
Oh, that special one
Sugar, sugar, that special one
Oh, that special one
Yeah, that special one, woo

[Verse 2]
There's something about the way you walk (Walk)
And there's something 'bout the way you talk (Talk)
And I saw you sitting there on the shelf (Shelf)
I knew I have to had you for myself (Self)
I only met you yesterday, but as strange as it seems
You answered all my prayers
You're the girl of my dreams (That special one)
Oh, I can't deny (You are that special one)
The one that caught my eye
[Chorus]
Oh, baby
You are my special one, Lord knows, baby
Oh baby, ooh

[Verse 2]
Something about the way you look (Look)
To describe her, I'd have to write myself a book (Book)
Oh babe, ooh, something 'bout the things you do (Do)
Oh, that has won my confidence in you, girl (You)
Oh, mama told me, someday, someone would set my soul on fire
Now I'm burning up, burning up, woo, burning with desire
I'm burning up, oh, burning up, hey, baby

[Bridge]
Oh, come here, baby
Woo, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, ain't nobody sweeter
And only Heaven knows how much I need you, girl
Sugar, I want you to understand
I place my whole life in your loving hands

There's something about the way that I feel
That makes me know that my love is real
Oh, you're that special one

You're that special one
Special one, that special one
Ooh, that special one
You are that special one, woo
That special one, woo, special one, ooh
Oh, oh my darling
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say

There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'

There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane

Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side

Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light

Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing

Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test

Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed

Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster

The Devil have his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners

Ay, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price
[Intro, Marvin Gaye, spoken]
Hey homeboy, how come everywhere you go
You have to go in a limousine, man?

[Other man]
Hey, man that's my thing

[Marvin]:
I know it's your thing
Every time I see you, you're awful clean
You got your rings, jewelry on
Y'know

[Other]:
Flashin' cash is what I need

[Marvin]:
I can understand it

[Verse 1]
Oh
I got the baddest cool
Could never be the fool
The ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make's superb
To doubt me is absurd
The latest and the greatest, you see

[Verse 2]
Oohh oo oohh
I want to have your spot
And more than what you got
I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed
And when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot
My diamonds shine a lot
Check out here this 450 SE babe (Ego trippin' out)

[Chorus]
I'm what's its all about
Ego tripping out (hey, tripping out, hey tripping out, you're tripping out, your tripping out)
Ahh ha hey hey
Without a doubt
I know we ego tripping out
Sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain
He don't want you, baby
I know you ego tripping out
'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt
I know you're ego tripping out
Hey she don't know it
But ain't it a shame, all the pain to come

[Verse 3]
I'm better than the rest
Check out the way I dress
And got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town
Is where I get down
You're lucky if I choose you my friend

[Verse 4]
Walk the greatest walk
I got to be the talk
I've got the greatest show in town
Woohoo! Rock with your other man then roll over to me
So I can thrill your soul baby
Aoow check out the love man standing tall and bold
Can fulfill your needs, too cold, baby
Needless to say, I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, ooh, ego tripping out
Yeah, ego tripping out, woooh!

[Outro]
In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
And some good old body heat
Aoow
Oh, baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money
Aoow
Turn the fear into energy
'cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfil the need
Aoow hey, hey
Only one way
Only one way
Wooh!
Feel the feelin, energy of the kiss
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold
You may give her furs and jewel
But they, they will only grow old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love is more precious than gold
I once made a decision in my life
A long, long, long time ago
I went for money instead of love
Now I'm so blue and it only goes to show
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson
Love, love, it's more precious than gold
You won't need no money
It's more precious than jewel
Get your hand on some loving
You won't need no money
It's more precious than gold
More precious, it's more precious than gold
[Verse]
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't you break my heart
Why do you want to leave me?
Why do you want to grieve me?
Why do we have to part
Couldn't give my love to anybody else
You've got me feeling sorry for myself
Baby, don't you leave me
Baby, I'm lonely
Oh, so lonely
When you left me before
That's when you promised
Oh yes, you promised
Not to leave me no more
You ought to hang your head in shame
The way you keep my little heart in pain
Baby, don't you leave me

[Bridge]
Said you'd never let anything come between you and me
I'm yours and I guess I'll be yours until you set me free

[Outro]
Don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Don't you make me cry
Let's stay together
Always together
Until the day we die
You know you're coming out hard to wait
You're going to fool around and make it great?
Baby, don't you leave me
Don't leave me, baby
Baby, don't you leave me
Please don't go
Baby, don't you leave me
My love is growing

[Verse]
Sitting down see the flower
On the window tops and the mountain
See the rain and the warm lit sun
On the beaches sand
Comes a man with a plan to renew the world
Up in Rasta land, hungry boys and girls
He lived up to his part
And he died with a cause in his heart

[Bridge]
Jamaica special love

Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
[Verse]
Treat me sweet &amp; gentle when you say good night
Squeeze me, please don't tease me
I get sentimental whenever you hold me tight
So squeeze me, but please don't tease me

[Chorus][x2]
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues each day
Counting the nights waiting for you
I want you to know
I never knew I'd love you so
Please say you love me too
When I get this feeling, I'm in ecstasy
Squeeze me, please don't tease me
Squeeze me, don't tease me
Mmh squeeze me, baby don't you tease me
I worry about you
When you're gone I get blue
So darling take care
I worry about you

I'm home every night
Wondering if you're alright
I knew when we met
That I'd worry about

You matter to me so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go

Whatever you do
Come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you

Honey, you, you, you matter to me
So, so, so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Baby, come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you
Oh, baby
Honey, I worry
Oh, yeah

When you're out of my sight
I worry
Each and every night
I worry
Oh, baby
I can't help myself
[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two

[Chorus]
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: "I love you

[Verse 2]
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And oh the night's so blue

[Chorus]
Oh-oh why
Why should I feel
So discouraged
I wanta know why
Should the shadows come
Hmm-hmm-hmm

Oh tell me why, why, why
Why should I feel so, so lonely, so lonely
And long, long for heaven and a home
Oh yeah

Since Jesus, since Jesus
Since Jesus is my potion
I wanta tell the world my constant
My constant friend
Oh is he
Please stay with me Jesus

I know, oh I know his eyes
His eyes are on the sparrow, yes it is
And I know Jesus watches
He watches over me
Oh thank you Jesus

I sing
People I can sing my song
'Cause, 'cause I'm happy, help me Jesus
Oh I sing, Lord I sing because I'm free
Oh, oh Jesus, Jesus, Jesus his eyes
His eyes on, on, yes it is, on the sparrow
And I know, Jesus, Jesus
Jesus watches me
Our Father
Which art in Heaven
Hallowed would be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
In earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day
Our daily bread
&amp; forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors
&amp; lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
&amp; the power
&amp; the glory
Forever
Amen
[Verse]
Oh, I won't cry anymore, now that you've left me
I won't cry anymore, now that you're gone
Oh baby, I've shed a million tears since we've been apart
But tears can never mend, well, my broken, my broken heart
I won't cry anymore, well, I'll just forget you
Oh, I'm closing the door, closing the door of memories
Well, though, though you're the one love that my arms are longing for
This is goodbye, well, I won't cry anymore
To me you're extra special mellow
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good
So when you say you love me, I really believe you, girl
For it's what you say and what you really do

Oh, you've got to understand, darling
The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
The world is not for long
(Got to pray and meditate)

There's only time for singing and praying
(We don't have the time to waste)
And having a love party
(Got to pray and meditate)

Go check out the times, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
What we need is a love explosion
(Got to pray and meditate)

We don't have no time to waste
(We don't have the time to waste)
Got to pray and meditate
(Got to pray and meditate)

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins
(Oh yeah)

To me you're really extra special mellow, baby
Oh, and the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
So when you say you love me, I believe you, baby
And it's good to party, fun to party with you, baby

To me you're extra special mellow, baby
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
Mmm, so when the party's over
Let's go create some loving, baby

Whoa, no time, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Fooling around, let there be peace and love
(Got to pray and meditate)

Oh baby, come here, come here, come here, darling
Oh, we need love
(Got to pray and meditate)
Love explosion, oh darling

Mmm, come here, come here, come here, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
[Intro]
Girl, before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

[Verse 1]
Well, I've got money, and I've got fame
But if you leave me, it don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging, baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying, love, to let you know
That's why I'm trying, baby, to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me

[Chorus]
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby

[Verse 2]
Your love, it made me ten feet tall
Your leaving leaves me nothing at all
What did I do, baby, to make you wanna go?
What did I say, baby, to hurt you so?
What's come between us? Can it be
Somebody has stole your love from me?
Oh, oh, oh baby
Baby, please, please don't leave me
If you leave me, baby, I'll be in misery

[Chorus]
No good without you, baby
I'll be no good without you, baby

[Verse 3]
Well, take my money, and take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
Oh, I'll keep on begging, baby, please don't go
And I'll love you harder than I did before
'Cause I'll be crying when you close the door
'Cause I know, I know when you go

[Chorus]
I'll be no good without you, baby
Baby, don't leave me
I'll be no good without you, baby
Oh, don't leave me, baby, baby
Oh, I'll be no good without you, baby
Say, baby
You know i want you
To let your light come shining through
Aww, baby
Baby, why don't you
Just let your light come shining through
Baby
No need to worry
Let your love come shining through
Honey
When in trouble
Let your love come shining through
Ohh, baby
You'll be happy
When your light come shining through
Baby
Life is a party
Let your love come shining through

Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Let it shine, baby
Shine all the time
Shine &amp; be kind
Then you'll feel fine
Then you'll be mine
Baby
Life is worth living
If you let your love come shining through
Aww, baby
The world is mellow
When you let your love come shining through

Mmmm, baby
You look so pretty while you dancin', baby
Shining
Look so pretty, shining, shining
Give it to me, shining, shining
Look so pretty, shining
Oh, baby
Let your love come shining through
Oh, darling
Let your light come shining through
Ooh, baby
The world is waiting
So let your light come shining through
Stevie
We really dig you
Hope you don't mind this riff from you

Ohh, praise Him when you go to work
Praise Him when your feelings hurt
Praise Him when you're feeling bad
Praise Him when you're feeling sad
All praises to the power
Praise Him by the love you give
Praise Him by the way you live
Praise Him even when you dance &amp; make romance
When you make romance
(let your light come shining through, BABY!)
Praise Him when you got no time
Praise Him whether rain or shine (shine shine shine shine shine)
Praise Him for the sunlighted sky
Praise Him for the moonlight
[Chorus]
I'm going home
See my mother
I'm going home
To see my dear old dad
I'm going home
To be with my sister
I'm going home
Won't my brother be glad?

[Verse 1]
Going home, yeah
Going to look out the window
I'm going home
To see what I saw in the past
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
I'm going home
Though I might be in rags
Been so long since
I began to roam
Never should have left home
Thought I was grown
But now I see what it meant to me

[Chorus]
I'm going home
See my mother
I'm going home
To be with dear old dad
I'm going home
To be with my sister
I'm going home and
Won't my brother be glad?
[Verse 2]
Going home
Look out the window
Going home
Do I see what I saw in the past?
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
Going home
Won't my mama be glad?

[Refrain]
It's been so long since I began to roam
Thought I'd make it on my own
All I wanna do is go home

[Verse 3]
Going home
See you mama
Going home
This whole world's treated me bad
Going home, daddy
Put your arm around you
Going home
Ah, I won't be sad
Going home
I've cried these teardrops
I'm going home
I don't know where to roam
Going home
I, I need
Going home
Won't I, won't I be glad
I'm going home
Where the sunshine is
I'm going home
There are no clouds of gray
Going home
See my old buddy
I'm going home
Shake my friends' hands today
[Refrain]
Whoa it's been so long
Since I began to roam
Thought I could make it on my own
But I now see, gotta go back

[Chorus]
I'm going home
See my mother
I'm going home
To be with my dear dad
Going home
To see my sisters
Going home
Won't my brother be glad?
Going home
See my mother
Going home
Kiss my dear old dad, woo
Going home
See my sister, yeah
Going home
Won't my brother be glad?

[Outro]
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
I don't know why you went away, girl
But I hope you won't be gone too long
No, no, no
I can't sleep, my hair's turning gray
See her in everything I do
But I found just the other day
My love for you went just too long
Yes it is, yes it is

Though you walked out on me
I can't set you free
I'm in love with you, baby
I'm in love with you, darling
Oh, baby

Honey, you walked out and broke my heart in two
You never gave a backward glance
No, no, no, no
I didn't know what you'd planned to do
You didn't give a warning in advance
No, no, darling
You didn't even take your clothes with you
You never gave sweet love a chance
No, no, no

Though you hurt me before
Please don't hurt me no more
I'm in love with you, baby
I'm in love with you, darling
Oh lord, baby
I can't wait for you to come back home
Girl, I think I'm coming after you
Oh, yes I am, 'cause I love you
'Cause I need you so bad
Girl, it's driving me mad
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
Darling, please don't leave me
Here to cry
Hail a cab
Come on by
Come on and end
This misery
Come on, baby
[Verse]
You don't drive a big fine car
You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes

[Chorus 1]
Satisfied, you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You got what it takes for me

[Chorus 2][x2]
You don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You've got what it takes for me
Now when you're near me
My head goes around and round
And when you kiss me
My love comes tumbling down
You send me

[Chorus 1]
When you loved me
I was walking on rainbows
Like nobody else has done
This will make you laugh
But darling I staked my dream on you, aww baby
This will make you laugh
They never did come true, they never did come true
I took a chance on young romance
And vowed it would not miss
But i never, never, never should have judged
A heart by a kiss
This is gonna make you laugh
But baby, i believed in you
For all my love, darling, you didn't see it through, boo-hoo
For all the fools, I break the rules
I love you, can't you see?
This will make you laugh
But it's not funny...
This shit ain't one bit funny to me
[Verse]
The shadow of your, of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, oh my love, and you'll see for sure
Ah baby, all the wonderful things you are to me
Darling, a wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
Darling, so did I

[Outro]
Oh, now when I remember spring
And all the joys that love can bring
I'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile
[Chorus]
Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

[Bridge]
I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet
[Chorus]
Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

[Verse 1]
Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet
I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string, I'm your puppet
Yeah, I'm your puppet
[Outro]
Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now
I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you
I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
[Verse 1]
As long as she needs me
I know where I, I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as she needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love her, right or wrong
And, somehow, I'll be strong
As long as she needs me

[Chorus]
If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

[Verse 2]
I won't betray her trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true, just
As long as she needs me

[Chorus]
If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so

[Verse 3]
I won't betray her trust
Though people say, say that I must
I've got to stay true, just
As long as she needs me
Paroles de la chanson I Live For You :
You

Marvin Gaye

You, you I see in my mirror in the mornin'

Instead of seein' me

I see you, I see your face

And inside me is a growing need for your embrace

In the light of day, though our faces meet

Someone there might see someone else speak

Till the dark of night, while the moon is new

While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous

Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so

Yes I need you, I need you baby

Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life

I'm just a heartbreakin' boy

Oh you've given your love to me

Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me

We're worlds apart, so close yet very far

So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts

We meet in shadows, your friends must never know

That we are lovers, darlin'

Alhough it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see

The press of love you're givin' me

But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine

I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before

And never let it show without each other's souls

I'll never one-way track 'cause there's no turnin' back

Oh I need you baby

[Répéter verse 1 and fade)
Oh, don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He made this world for us to live in and gave us everything
And all He asks of us is we give each other love, oh ya
Don't go and talk about my father
'Cause God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it
Just loves us, oh ya
And He'll forgive all our sins
Forgive all our sins
And all He asks of us, is we give each other love
Oh ya
Love your mother, she bore you
Love your father, he works for you
Love your sister, she's good to you
Love your brother, your brother
Don't go and talk about my father, He's good to us
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
For when we call in Him for mercy, Mercy Father
He'll be merciful, my friend, oh, yes He will
All he asks of us, I know, is we give each other love, oh ya
[Verse 1]
Right around the corner there is an angel, yeah
And all I hope and pray, I'll make her my girl
So, if I have wings of gold, I'd fly to you, my love
Yes, I would
And on my way to you I'll catch a star from above

[Pre-Chorus]
Straight away I'll fly to cloud number nine
See if my baby was feeling fine
When I get there, this is what I'd say

[Chorus]
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please, I love you

[Verse 2]
Now right around the corner there is an angel
If Phyllis only knew, oh how she ran into you
Yes, she would!

[Verse 3]
The beauty of your love shines trough and trough
And all, all without you
I know my world will come to an end
But I feel you float beside me
With each day, a new dawn begins

[Chorus]
Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please
Oh. walkin' with your halo on
Hello angel, yes darling, I want to take you home
[Marvin speaking]
You know, not so long ago
People used to have these tales
Going back and forth about who
Could make the best love
These things get a little out of hand, baby
You know what I mean
I'm just trying to straighten this thing out, that's all
I wanna tell everybody like it really is

[The Waters]
It's getting bigger
It's getting bigger

[Marvin]
Savage, baby!
Savage in the sack
I won't hurt you, darling
I just wanna show you where it's at
Love so good, baby
Like you know I would
And all the time
Savage in the sack

Not too long ago, I told a friend
I ain't had none
Since you and Lord knows when
Stayed up for days
Never been satisfied
Soon as I get ya, baby
I'll make you cry
'Cause savage, baby
Savage in the sack
I ain't gon' hurt you, darling
Just gon' show you where it's at
Hit me
Feels so good
You know you got to love it
I know you would

Look here
You know where it's at
Sooner or later, baby
Get you back
You know where you gon' get it
Come with me so we can get down
Savage, baby
Savage in the sack
We ain't gon' hurt you, darling
Just wanna show you where it's at
Hit me
Hit me, baby
Like you know we would
Hit me
Savage in the sack
Ain't gon' hurt you
Know you need me
To be released
And don't tell nobody, baby
Unless you don't call
I'm gonna leave
We're savages!
Savage in the sack
We love it, we love
Got to get you back
Scream! You savage!
[Verse]
I could have left and said I told you so
(Told you so)
I could have told the whole wide world and leave you sad and blue
(Sad and blue)
Said I could have left and said it's good for you, yeah now
But I know when it hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)
I could have said that you had it coming to you
(Coming to you)
When you walked out and turned your back on me
(Back on me)
I played it, baby, all along, please, please baby, don't go
'Cause I knew he would hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)
He said he had you dancing on a string
As far as love goes, you were just another fling
Oh, I may be a fool to love you the way I do
(Way I do)
Don't you realize even fools have feeling too
So baby, come on back
And let me dry the tears from your eyes

[Bridge]
'Cause I would never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
No, no I'd never hurt you
(I will never hurt you)
'Cause baby when he hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too
(Hurt me too)

[Outro]
It hurts me so bad
(Hurt me too)
I'd never desert you
(Hurt me too)
[Verse 1]
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stayed locked up in my room
I know to you it might sound strange

[Chorus]
But I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Because so badly I want to go outside (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't suppose to cry, listen
I got to cry because crying eases the pain, oh yeah
People this hurt I feel inside, words can never explain

[Chorus][x3]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Day in, day out, my tear stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain
Because raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying, crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears, I refuse to explain

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
Oh, yeah, yeah listen
I'm a man and I got my pride
Give me rain or I'm going to stay inside
Let it rain

[Outro]
Let it rain[x3]
(Let it (rain) (rain) (rain) rain, rain)
[Verse]
You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is
You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

[Chorus 1]
Do you know how lost I've been
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

[Chorus 2]
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You don't know, you don't know [3x]
What love Is
Well, these are just a bunch of guys from Detroit
Name of Bohannon
They can play the music straight
But they thought they'd double clutch it for you

So, you see, they got together
These cats sure are funky
And they thought you might dig a little dance
Called the Double Clutch

You see, these is just a bunch of cats from Detroit
Called Bohannon and them cats
So they got together and thought of this funky thing
They wanted y'all to do the Double Clutch

Sure is funky

You see, these cats from Detroit
Bohannon and Ray and Melvin
Playing the Double Clutch

Now, all through this album
We played the double up
Well, by now you should be deep in it

It's all over about now, y'all
We hate to leave you
But we got to go
[Verse 1]
[TT:] My loving heart would shake
More than the earth could break
If you should ever go
You know my heart would break
[MG:] If I lost your sweet embrace
Even time could not erase
The memories of you
Tears would cover up my face

[Chorus]
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you, baby
[MG:] I need you so
[BOTH:] Oh how I'd miss you
[TT:] Baby never go
[MG:] I'll never leave

[Verse 2]
[TT:] My world would cease to be
Without the love you give to me
The chains around my heart
Would never set me free
[MG:] When my life had just begun
My sky didn't have a sun
You fill my every need
So if you ever leave
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[MG:] Oh you're always on my mind
Losing you would leave me blind
Fill my heart forevermore
Never leave my love behind
[TT:] With the joy your love can bring
To you I'll always cling
If you took away your love
It would be the end of things

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Looking good

Oh woman
Liberated lady of today
Remember all our childhood days (Remember?)
Boy and girl, we used to play
Do you remember, baby?

Hey, freedom (Freedom)
Emancipation's what you found
Legislation put me down, oh yeah
What happened to yesterday? (What happened?)

Woman of the world
Now that your eyes meet mine
You see a brand new generation
You're where you want to be
(You've come a long way, baby)
(You've come a long way, baby)

Hey, woman (Woman of the world)
Chauvinism's day is done (Chauvinism's day is done)
Now there isn't anyone, no, no (Now there isn't anyone)
For you to look up to (You're on your own now)
(You're on your own)
Lady, hey baby, independence is your thing, listen
You got the world on a string
Go on and take your time
Oh, woman of the world
What would you prefer be done?
After all we've done together
You want to pull away now

(You've come a long way, baby)
Hey, woman of the world (You've come a long way, baby)
My yesterday girl (You've come a long way, baby)
Little lady, oh (You've come a long way, baby)
Baby, it's your show, it's your show
(You've come a long way, baby)
You are my girl, woman (You've come a long way, baby)
Woman of the world (You've come a long way, baby)
Yesterday girl (You've come a long way, baby)
It's your show, it's your show (You've come a long way, baby)
It's your, it's your show (You've come a long way, baby)
Baby, it's your show (You've come a long way, baby)
Baby, it's your show (You've come a long way, baby)
(You've come a long way, baby)
(You've come a long way, baby)
Life is a gamble, oh, oh baby
Where you win or lose
I'm right, just paid my dues
[Verse 1]
Oh, I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me
True love (Mmm-hmm) is hard to find
(Oh yeah) Mmm-hmm
So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find, mmm-hmm
That's what they would say
The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said

[Chorus]
Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get so lonely (Lonely)
It seems useless to go on
But then I remember
Somewhere true love is waiting there
But I'll keep on holding on (Holding on)
But I'll keep on keeping on (Keeping on)
But I know that I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying

[Chorus]
Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh

[Verse 3]
Now there is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm going to keep on keeping on
You know that I'm going to keep holding on
Because I now if I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying

[Chorus]
Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Oh, oh
Seek and you shall find
Is it love that you're looking for?
Seek, oh, and you shall find
It might be right around the corner
Seek...
[Verse 1]
Here I stand lonely, just a heartbroken guy
I used to be a laugher, 'till I made my baby cry
And I knew my baby loved me, I was overconfident
So I did her wrong, now she's gone, I don't know which way she went

[Chorus]
My baby forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow

[Verse 2]
But the way the ball bounces, that's the way the cookie crumbles
From the top to the bottom, that's a long way to tumble
Oh when you realize that you're no longer first on your baby's list
And the home you thought you had forever no longer exists

[Chorus]
You wake up and you discover what a great fool you have been
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, what kind of fool am I?
To know that you love me and yet I made you cry
Baby when I think it over
It's fault that I'm here, gone, but I'd like to do it over
And would deliver my love to you warm
And on and on

[Chorus]
Oh darling you forgave me so much time and time and time again
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
Cause when your baby starts to walk away
And tells you no need to follow
And nothing you do, seems to make her stay
It's a bitter pill to have to swallow
[Intro]
There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little rough, child
There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little tough

[Verse 1]
Oh, but if you and me, oh baby, got unity
Hey, girl, me for you and you for me
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's gonna be times, I know, girl
When you might wanna just sit right down and cry
Hey, hey, hey, hey
But don't you let that bother you, girl
'Cause when you need me, girl
I'm gonna be standing right by your side

[Chorus]
'Cause we got love, so much love
Oh, we can make it, baby
Oh, girl, we got that kind of love
That all our friends admire
The kind I like to boast about
The kind that I can't live without
[Bridge]
Nothing's always gonna be like a distant dream
I'll be your realest friend when you need me, girl
So come on, girl, let's take the world
Come on now, let's do it, let's do it, woo
Come on now

[Chorus]
Oh, we got love
Oh, we can make it, baby
Oh, we got love, wonderful sweet love
And we can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
We can make it, baby
Oh, we can make it
Gonna make it, baby
Yeah, make it, baby
[Verse 1]
Seems just yesterday you were in my arms
And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared
I did all I know
To win your love and make it so

[Bridge]
You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you
How could you do me this way?

[Chorus]
Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm going to make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home

[Chorus]
Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know

[Outro]
Oh baby, oh baby
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, going to make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
Because I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chained
I was so proud of myself
As a lover before you came
I never begged no girl to love her
Out of the eight million people in the city
I chose you, and you're not even pretty
I was the stronger one of any two
This time isn't me, it's you

You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do
Oh, baby, honey, honey

I'm trying hard to keep
The upperhand
But now I losing
My ground as a man
Today the sharpest looking girl came around
For the first time in my life, I turned one down
I love this girl and I was on to the next one
But I can't find no one that loves, you're the best one

You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do
Oh, wrapped around your finger, baby
That's right darling

I fight myself
But I fight a losing battle
I try to tell my foolish self
It don't matter
You're number one as a lover
I'm number two
I try harder to recover

You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do

I don't want
Do things I don't want to do
But you make me
Yes, you do
Oh!
[Chorus 1]
Oh, the world's situation should be Rated X, Rated X
Said, the world's situation should be Rated X, yeah Rated X
Listen people!

[Verse 1]
Not only in the movie shows
Take a look outside it's where the truth is really told
It's life in living color
Fighting, killing and dope dealing, it's everywhere

[Chorus 2]
What about the crime? Rated X
What about the killing, fighting, stealing everywhere?
They let the children see life destroyed
But they won't let them see its making
Oh what happened to God's creation?

[Verse 2]
The one thing that really bothers me the most
Is how we calmly take the lives of other folk
The world today is in a grave situation
Dirty water we can't drink, dirty air, it's so unfair
Oh, I know something is missing all over the world
Oh, Rated X, ooh, Rated X, ooh, Rated X baby
I know something is missing all over the world
[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
Where's the love? Where's the peace?
Where's the joy? Where's the hope for us all?
Love has been Rated X
Hate is all the way Rated X

[Chorus 1]
[Verse]
World, I'm not the same
I can't remember my name half the time
I took a walk - I thought I'd get some air
But was really not aware of what I said or what I did
I never see the dark of night or the light of day
I took a walk into the park and never saw the children play
Everything I see is a crazy kind of mystery to me
I'm flirting with the mother of insanity
Oh, babe, where is my mind?
Since you left me it's been hard to find
Sugarwhere, where is my mind?
It started to rain, and I felt insane
But one thing's for sure: it's going to rain forever more
Until you come back to me, please, babe
World, I'm not the same
I go somewhere and can't remember how I came
I'm completely turned around, lost in space
It's your face I see constantly
I never know from right or wrong, or anything
I'm like a desperate man
Just see me try to cling
To the only other parts you've left to me
I'm flirting, I'm flirting with uncertainty
Oh, bring back my mind
Since you left me, honey
I can't find it
Oooh, honey, bring back my mind
I'm starting to say
More and more every day
Please release my soul
Give me back control of my mind
Only you can save me
[Verse]
Hey, hey, hey
There is a joy in a sweet word that's been spoken
And the joy in a dream that's come true
There's a joy that I get when I'm watching you baby
And the joy that I get watching the skies of blue
And then there's a joy, oh my darling, of a crying baby
And the joy of a child that's born to you
Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady
And the joy of the morning dew

[Bridge]
It's something like the joy of loving you baby, joy of dancing too
It's something like the joy of loving you baby, joy of being with you

[Outro]
Oh my darling, I'll overcome the darkest nights
Just to see your love's alright
I've got a love to give
You know I love to live
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
Damn, Good God
[Chorus]
I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

[Verse 1]
Whenever we're together, not a word do you say
When I speak your name in the softest tone
It's as though I'm all alone that's why

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
Anymore, not like before

[Verse 2]
You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss, there's no sincerity
I do believe you've gotten over me
[Chorus][x2]
Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing the girl that's suppose it have to love me forever
I'm gonna make sure
That she has a heart of gold yeah
And the love to whole me

Falling, that's way I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, not I, not me

Do you believe?
I wise man once told me a long time ago
'If a women don't love you, let her go'
I don't need you baby

That's way I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know if it that kind of love
That's gonna last me forever
Don't gonna waste precious time
Don't play lovers part, coz I one day end up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, not me, not me, not I, not me

Taking my time making up my mind
Choosing, choosing
[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There isn't a place I'd like to be instead of grooving
Have mercy on a crowded avenue
Don't you know we doing anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can pick anyone we like to be
With all those happy people we could meet
Just setting the groove

[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon

[Verse 2]
Groove with me baby
We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
We're going to talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly
[Chorus]
Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon
Okay, so your heart is broken
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you even think about dying
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, dig this

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes, they cannot see a certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

How can you help it, when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Every plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool
[Chorus x3]
Ain't it funny
No it just ain't funny
How things turn around
How things turn around

Once we loved each other so deeply
We talked to each other so sweetly
Now, we don't even talk at all
Only, only on the telephone

When I call
Talking about the kid
Talking about the baby
Talking about the baby

People think life is a game
Life is a game
People think life is a game
They think life is a game, baby

Ain't it strange? It ain't never the same
Gonna turn around, baby
Turn it around, soon
Gonna be getting down
Got to turn around, going to turn it around
Please, please don't ever go away
And if you wonder, please, please
Don't ever go away

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we baby?
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, baby
Ain't it funny, baby
How things turn around, honey, honey
Ain't it funny, how things turn around
Look at you, baby

If we work together, we can help things turn around
Can't we, baby?
F-U-N-N-Y, help it turn around
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around
Ooh, baby
Look at you, baby
F-U-N-N-Y, help things turn around

[Outro]
F-U-N-N-Y
Turn it all around, baby
[Verse 1]
Like a breath of spring you came
& as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumbling
Honey, you don't owe me anything because

[Chorus]
What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Verse 2]
You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Verse 3]
Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
And though I know you're leaving
I won't be grieving 'cause I know
Time has a way of showing us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
Because what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Outro]
I'm going to live once again
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
I love you, I love you
Hey now, and what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last
Every time I see you, I'm spinning like the tops
Intoxicated lady, what you doing? Don't you stop
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Oh
You're what's happening in the world today

In my sleep I see you, darling, and you're lovely as a queen
Intoxicated lady, you bring joy to my dreams
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Hey
You're what's happening in the world today, oh baby

You're like a drink of something that's much too much
And get a kiss from you, it thrill me through and through
Now I don't know for sure but I think you'd like it too
Cause, oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
I said, baby

You should be in movies, in a fashion magazine
Any king would be so proud just to have you for a queen
A leading lady is what you are, girl you sho' nuff a star
You shall receive an award for the part you play in my heart
Oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
Oh baby, little darling
I know, I know
Don't my mama, don't tell father
No, no
Oh honey, baby
[Intro]
Try it, you'll like it
What the world needs now
Is a little more love
Little more love
Little more love
Just a little more love

[Verse 1]
Can't be no love
When there's nothing but pain inside
Can't see no love
When you're looking through too much pride
Oh, peace, love, understanding
In the eye of the beholder
People are staying home
When they got chips on their shoulder
We must all work together
We must help one another

[Chorus]
Oh, people
Try it, you'll like it
What the world needs now's
Just a little more love
Little more love
[Verse 2]
You better watch that man
Standing there pointing the finger
Just like a bee, getting ready to sting ya
Health, wealth and freedom
It wouldn't be hard to find
How you gon' get it together
With chains around your mind?
We must all work together
Lord have mercy
We must all love one another

[Chorus]
Try it, oh, you'll like it, people
(What the world needs now is a little more love)
Try it, you'll like it
It's all up to you now
Well, whatcha gon' do?
True to life as a mirror
And the reflection is you, you, you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
Oh, try it (You'll like it)
What the world needs now
(Just a little more love)
Hey, hey
(Just a little more love)
(A little more, little more love)
[Outro]
Oh, try it, I know you'll like it
(What the world needs now is a little more love)
Love it, love it
Peace, understanding, harmony
Come on, people
(What the world needs now is just a little more love)
Come on, everybody (Try it)
Come on, people (You'll like it)
(What the world needs now is just a little more love)
Everybody (Try it)
Come on, people (You'll like it)
Everybody
(What the world needs now is just a little more love)
Come on, people (Try it)
Come on, people (You'll like it)
Oh, everybody

Come on, love us (Try it)
Love everybody (You'll like it)
Come on, people, yeah, oh yeah yeah
(What the world needs now is just a little more love)
[Verse 1]
Oo, you say you're feeling bad cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely

[Chorus]
If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

[Verse 2]
I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose
[Chorus]
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than painting the town
Only noon and night
Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darling, I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Darling, everybody need somebody, o I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why

[Chorus]
Poor Abbey Walsh
Poor...whooo
Chalky just washed him away
& they're gonna put the blame
On Mr. T
[Intro]
Hey girl, what you doin'?
You gettin' up?
Yeah, you got to go?

Honey, honey, honey

You know

And I'll take you, baby
Anywhere
[Chorus]
Oh, you for me and me for you
And we'll go through this old world
Together
'Til tomorrow
So have a heart, I'm yours completely
Say you will be mine so sweetly
Oh, baby, 'til tomorrow comes girl
I love you, baby

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, baby

The other night
As I lay sleeping, yeah
I dreamed I held you
Held you in my arms
But when I woke up this morning
I found out I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
Hung my head and I, yes baby I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine
(You are my sunshine)
Ohh, my only sunshine

[Chorus]
I wanna say right here
That you're my sunshine
(You are my sunshine)
Yeah my only sunshine
(My only sunshine)
I said you make me happy
(You make me happy)
When my skies are grey

Sugar you'll never know

Just how much I love you

I don't want you to take

I don't want you to take

No, no, I love her

No, not this morning

[Verse 1]
There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm going to meet the girl that I left behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got

[Verse 2]
There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things she said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
Because in your arms is where I want to be

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
[Bridge]
Baby, oh baby, my little darling
I'm coming home

[Verse 3]
The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
Instrumental
Honey, I found something
Yes, I found something
All that I ever wanted
I found in you, my heart's desire
Everything, everything about you
Makes me wish for the days gone by

'Cause everyday that I spent without you
Honey, was wasted 'cause nothing was gained
That could give my life a purpose
Until into my heart you came
And I knew I found something
Honey, I found something
Listen to me, baby

All that I ever needed
I found in you in an everlasting stream
Flowing with goodness and understanding
All that I hoped for or I dared to dream
But honey with love that you imparted
I built my dreams on a solid foundation
Free from hurt and being broken-hearted
Mixed with faith and inspiration
'Cause I found something
Honey, honey I found something
Oh, you're my shelter in stormy weather
My weakness has turned to strength
Knowing that as long as we're together
My life will be well spent
'Cause I found something
I found something
Listen, baby, now I can rest
And be at east
Honey, your lovin' is all I need
All I ever wanted, I found in you
You're my heart's desire
[Chorus 1]
St. Louis woman, with your diamond rings
St. Louis man, you just don't mean a thing

[Verse]
You came a long way from St. Louis
You climbed the ladder of success
I've seen the town and country cars
That were parked out in front of your fancy address
You came a long way from St. Louis
You broke a lot of hearts between
I've seen a gang of gloomy girls
Who were doing alright until you came on the scene

[Chorus 2]
You blew in from the Middle West
And certainly impressed the population hereabouts
Now listen, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too
So naturally I got my doubts
You got them dropping by the wayside
A feeling I ain't going to know
You came a long way from St. Louis
And you still got a long way to go

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Intro]
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

[Verse 1]
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
And on that day, when I up and leave you
You can beat your life that I won't be back no more
Sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm just a fool for you
Nobody has to tell me the way I am
It's the way I feel that make a difference
You see I love you so much that I don't care how I am

[Bridge]
Hey now, what am I supposed to do
When you find out your love was untrue
Hey now, just have to stay
'Cause I don't have enough left to walk away

[Verse 4]
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
Until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with me
[Verse 1]
Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby

[Chorus 2]
You'll see
Nobody loves you but me

[Verse 2]
Now you tell me that you so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine

Well move on back cross the track, baby
Where you came from
[Chorus 1]
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby

[Chorus 2]
You'll see
Nobody loves you but me

[Outro]
I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friend, friend, friend
But take your name from the bright lights baby
And tell me that you are all through
Come on and
Try it honey
Try it baby
Try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see, nobody loves you but me
[Verse 1]
Funny, how I've stopped loving you
I can listen to your name and it doesn't start a flame
Not much, so much my heart wants to cry
Oh oh oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
It's funny how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny I don't miss all the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you too much

[Bridge]
Now that you are standing here, darling, I won't shed a tear
This is just the rain in my eyes
And if I have proved to you that everything I say is true
Please help me believe my own lies

[Outro]
Girl, it's funny how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny I don't miss all of the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you, not too much, baby, not too much
Oh, you went away and left me, baby
I don't love you, too much
Just with all my heart, dear
[Verse]
I wonder my darling
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder
My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh, but right now I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been through lover's lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been traveling nowhere faced
And what I want to know, what I want to know is will it last?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?
Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Oh yeah he-he baby I wonder

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder
[Verse 1]
Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Chorus]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

[Verse 2]
Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

[Chorus]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

[Bridge]
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

[Outro]
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love
(Funk, funk, funk for love)
(Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong
Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong...)

It's the love, funky music and the feeling can't control
Oh no, funky music and the rhythms in my soul
Hey, sweet love funky music and the beats in my head
I love funky music and my lady understands

She can be funky, he can be funky, I can be funky too
With your love
You can be funky, we can be funky, I can be funky too
With some of your love
Home is where you live and play and laugh and be happy
Making love every day
We already know how to blues it

Sweat down my spine, feeling fine
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
Take every chance to make romance
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
What do I have now that is my greatest gift?
And it came to me one day, this is what it is

It's love that I'm looking for, baby, oh darlin'
Said it's love, baby, that I want to be about, oh baby
Hey hey love, baby, that I want to be, ooh
Said it's love, what I want and really need, baby - yeah!
I need your attention, baby, yeah yeah, looking for more love
Honey, do you, do you want me, baby, hey, to give you my love?
Oh, baby

Sometimes I don't need to cry
But there are the pitfalls of life
Here come the tears in my eyes
We accept the pleasure, we, we accept the pain
Ooh, heart, my heart
Oh baby, my heart
Ooh baby, my heart
Ooh, ooh baby, my heart
Come on baby, give up some love

Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best
Shake your motion to the East
Shake your motion to the West
Give your heart and your body to the one you love the best

Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Please let's all get funky if you take the good
Please let's all get funky if you take the evil
Come let's all get funky if you take the good

It's all right baby, to get funky
Oh baby, it's all right to get funky with love's creation, baby
Get funky, baby, funky with love
Now, uh, folks have said the world is coming to an end, baby
I wonder... in our lifetime?
Oh well, let's make love
[Chorus]
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories

[Verse 1]
I recall a time as we used to sit for hours
Holding hands, I used to buy you flowers
With our hearts together
Nothing mattered
I remember dreams I had and plans we made
Oh I'd grow in love girl to cascade
Oh but the dreams are all shattered

[Pre-Chorus]
What can I do now that your love has left my life
My dreams are cut to shreds by jealous, hateful lies
The knife was made of lies and schemes that we knew so well
To turn our glowing love into a cold and empty shell

[Chorus]
Leaving me with memories, girl, and harmony
Memories, oh, how love ought to be
Oh, precious memories
Ooh baby, precious memories
[Verse 2]
I was a fool, I know
Honey and don't it show?
It can't help but shine
Here is a grown man crying
Mixed up in confusion
So badly disillusioned
This precious love I've had
Slipped away so fast

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the plan is gone and there's a reasonable substitute
I just saw myself crying, it didn't look too cute
I found a single blood you dropped and you hate to part
I used it to press my tears and held it to my heart

[Chorus]
It brought back memories
Reminding me how love used to be
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
Memories, precious memories
[Verse 1]
Ooh, the girl I love walked out on me
Leaving her love flowing strong
Oh, my heart would like to carry on
But she said her feeling for me was gone
I tried to find the words to say to make her stay

[Chorus]
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

[Verse 2]
I know the girl is on her way
Taking the love I need so bad
Oh, the love I guessed I'd never have
So what's the use of sitting around and feeling sad
I must respect the fact she won't be back my way

[Chorus]
Cause she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

[Bridge]
I sit around in misery
Over a love that don't belong to me
I did everything I could to make her stay

[Chorus]
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change it, baby
Oh, change if you want to
You got to change, alright
Oh, change it, honey
Honey, you can change it
[Verse]
All I can say is you held me tight
Just give me more, more, more, more kissing, baby
More, more, more, more hugging, honey
I just can't get enough of your sweet loving, oh it's so good
It makes me want to love you like a lover should
Oh give me more, more, more squeezing baby
I want more, more, more teasing, honey
I just can't get enough of your sweet loving, it's so good
It makes me want to love you like a lover should
My mama told me "Girl"
She said "Men won't do you nothing but harm"
Oh Tammi, what Mama don't know is
How good it feels when you're in my arms
I want more, more, baby
More, more, more, more, more
I just can't get enough of your sweet loving, &amp; oh so good
It makes me want to love you like a lover should
So give me more, more, more kissing, baby
More, more, more hugging, honey
More, more, more squeezing
More, more, more teasing
I just can't get enough of your sweet loving, it's so good
It makes me want to love you like a lover should

[Outro]
So give more, more, oh baby
Just a little bit more, oh yeah
Baby, going to take me more, oh baby
Just a little bit more, ooh yeah
Teeny bit more...
[Repeats in background]
(Heart... Beat... Heart... Beat)
If you let me girl (Feels so good, jammin' is fun)
I'll be good to you (Got me wonderin' if I'm gonna be the one)
I will hug and kiss you  (Way you dance, look so nice)
Tenderly (being with you is paradise)

If you let me (I'm wonderin' if you're wonderin' too)
I'll be good to you (About a lifetime, me and you)
I will hug and kiss you (I'd like to see you everyday)
Tenderly (I love you, girl, in every way)

Baby (Feels so good holding your hand)
Got me wondering if I'm gonna be your man
Got my heart racing wild
Surely I love you honey child

You've come to take away the rain
The sun inside me shines again
So if you go I'm out of luck
I've really got to have you, baby

Funk me
Funk me
Funk me, funk me
Funk me
I need us for me to love
Mother nature taught me love
Love is all that I can see
Let's make love a cup of tea
We don't really have to freak
You just thrill me when you speak
I can see that you're a star
And I like the way you are
There's no need for us to stall
Come, let's answer nature's call
Funky music lights my fire
Shakes my body, sexified
Girl, we both have lots of love
Send some loving up above
Don't give me no advice
See the love that's in my eyes

All I know is how much I want you, baby
Oooh, I'm really crazy about you, girl
And darling I'd like to love you, right now, right now, right now
Forevermore, baby!
Watching you out here dancing on the floor, baby
Makes me want to love you all the more, baby

For when, little darling, we begin
I know my love for you will never, never end
Ah baby
Darling, please give me a chance
To prove in advance
I don't know if I can go on without having you for my own
Oh, father above
Give me this lady for me to love
So that I can love her right now
Ooooh, all of my love is for you to share
I will take you, darling, anywhere
I wanna love you right now, really, really

[Repeats]
I'd like to make love to you (funk me, funk me baby)
I'd like to make love with you (funk me, funk me, funk me baby)

I'd like to make love to you baby, right now
I'd like to make love to you darling, right now
While I'm away, darling
How often do you think of me?
Remember, I'm over here
Fighting to keep us free
Just be my little girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

They say I'm now a man and should be spotted hard
But I don't think I'll make it, dear
If you don't play your part
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

Soldier boy to you
We all must do our share
And darling, I don't mind
The only thing that's greed in me is leaving you behind

Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a loving soldier boy
I'll be a faithful soldier boy
I'll be a loving soldier boy to you
[Instrumental]
[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Like the birds in the trees, my heart sings a rhapsody of love for you
Girl, you won my heart the very first time I laid eyes on you
I know your love belongs to someone else
But girl, I got to have you for myself

[Chorus]
So, I'm going to keep on trying
Just keep on trying until I win your love, woo
Going to keep on trying
Just keep on trying until I win your love, woo

[Verse 2]
A fallen star that's what you are, from the heavens above
There's no treasure on earth, that can match your worth
You're a picture of love
I know to you I'm just a love sick guy
But you're wrong
I love you and I need you, by my side

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Aw, yeah
Baby
Keep on
[Verse 3]
I can't help but thinking about that guy
He just got you by his side
He's got everything
There's is no inch of his happiness to be in his place
I'll be glad to give you anything
I know your love belongs to him
But girl, I can't be satisfied just being your friend

[Chorus][x2]
[Verse]
How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel to be where you are
How far is the journey from here to a star?

[Outro]
And if I left you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?
Distant lover, lover
So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn
Through the day
Distant lover
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery, misery
As I reminisce, oh baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then, all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road
Distant lover
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel?
Sugar, sugar
That every moment when I spent with you
I treasure it like it was
A precious jewel, oh baby
Lord have mercy
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
My Lord I wonder
Do you wanna hear me scream, plead
And please, please, oh please baby
Come back and hold me, girl
Baby please, please
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yea, it makes me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God know where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long
[Verse 1]
It takes a real good woman to know how to love a good man
It takes some hugging and kissing, but most of all some understanding
And I've got all of the hugging and kissing and understanding I want

[Chorus]
That's why I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Mad about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Now you can talk about your real fine chicks, say they're nice and sweet as they can be
But I've got a woman suits me to a T
Now she may not look like Venus, she's good enough for me

[Chorus]
And I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Crazy about my baby
Wild about my baby
And it's plain to see she crazy 'bout me

[Verse 3]
Now me and my baby, yeah, yeah, we're doing all right
We love one another, vow to treat each other right
Now I've got enough woman to last me for the rest of my life
[Chorus]
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
Mad about my baby
Wild about my baby
So wild about my baby
And I know for sure she crazy 'bout me
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
I'm crazy 'bout my baby
[Chorus 1]
It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumbling from my eyes

[Verse 1]
We fell in love, first day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say

[Chorus 2]
It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile
We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah

Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
No, no baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yea, it makes me wanna holler

Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Dah, dah, dah
Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Simply cause we wear our hair long
[Verse 1]
Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over, baby
I got to get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman
More than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around
You'd surely tear it all apart

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road

[Verse 2]
Woman, I'm just thinking about all the times you promised to call
And I sat at home lonely
You only did it because you knew I love you only
Running, running around with every guy in town
I'm telling you, woman, no longer will I be your clown

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
I'm tired of your stuff
Say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more

[Verse 3]
Woman, there's no sense in you begging and pleading
To hold on when I'm the one you're leaving
Say I've about had my fill of you (had my fill of you)
Flirting's all through the years
And I've almost run out of tears
I'm telling you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to

[Chorus]
The road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm giving you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road

[Outro]
(Oh, this is the end, the end of our road)
Baby please don't cry
When we say goodbye
'Cause it's only for a while, you see
You're all that matters to me

So, baby, hold your head way up high
I know it's really hard, but try
And this is the reason why
You're all that matters to me

For God only knows
The things my heart never shows
You're the best thing that ever happened to me
Can't you see

So wipe the tears from your eyes
There'll be no more cloudy skies
As long as you realize
You're all that matters to me
To me
Baby, to me
To me
Strange dear
But true dear
When I'm close to you dear
The stars fill the sky
So in love with you am I
Yes, I am

Even without you
My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night
Mysterious, yeah baby
When you first were there
In love with my joy
Delirious, when I knew that you
Could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours till I die
So in love, so in love, so in love
With you, my love
Well, my... I'm so in love with you
Oh, in love...
[Marvin scatting]
Just because you're so pretty, baby
Wondering if I can talk to you
I wonder if you love me
I wonder if you wonder too, girl
Hey, hey, hey
You are the woman on my mind
I believe, baby
Just let me walk you over
Take me to paradise
Oh, sugar
I might love you, baby
Like to love you all of your life
So wonderful, so sweet, so pretty
You got everything that I need
You're so complete, baby
Oh, girl, let me kiss you on your neck
I love you, baby

[Marvin scatting]
I like the way you love me, baby
I like the way that you rub me down
I like the sound of your voice, baby
And when you fool around
Oh, can I come see you now
Love your pretty way
You know, you know I love you, baby
And I wanna be your man
Oh, tell me that you want me
I want to know right now
I think because you're so, so pretty
That I don't stand a chance
But they say that, oh, you got to have some lovin'
Just like everybody else
And I can love you good
I got to think, take care of you, baby
And I know how to do.... Ho!
Wind it up all round me, pretty girls come at me
I ain't got no problem, I think it's so unfair
Patience it's opportune, that's what I've been told
But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah

I get and I'm probably patient, between my sugar and I
Said I'm gonna rock do one of those patsy demo
You're my surprise, sure I got it all in my soul
Wanna get more cuz I got to get my hand on some lovin
Before I'm too old,much too old, yeah, yeah

I said I need a women, need some lovin'
One love yeah, yeah
I hear that I over valley
Pretty women, pretty women
And I ain't got nobody, think is so unfair
Patience they say it's a virtue that's what I've been told

But I got to get my hand on some lovin'
Before I'm too old, too old, yeah, yeah
Before I'm not too old
Before I'm not too old, yeah
[Verse]
Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
Because we got a life of love that
Won't ever change
Everyday love me
Your won special way
Melt all my heart
With a smile
Take time to tell me
You really care
And we'll share tomorrow
Together always forever love you
I'll always love you forever

[Outro]
Ever ever ever
Baby
[Verse 1]
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
And though he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Verse 2]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"

[Outro]
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"
[Verse 1]
I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several stories high

[Chorus]
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

[Verse 2]
Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And oh! The towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and star
They don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be
Let the time go by
I won't care if I
[Outro]
[Verse 1: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Verse 2: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
But at last you'll find out that don't compare
To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Verse 3: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
Oh baby, let's do it today
Inflection
Give us protection

[Verse 4: Both, Marvin Gaye, & Tammi Terrell]
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
That's what we've got
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, oh, it ain't easy
[Verse 1]
My Funny Valentine
Sweet comic valentine -
You make me smile, with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

[Chorus]
Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Verse 2]
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't baby don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day
