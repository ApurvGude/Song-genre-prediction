[Verse 1: Father]
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy
I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm
When you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Why, think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

[Verse 2: Son]
How can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
It's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go
[Verse 3: Father &amp; (Son)]
It's not time to make a change (Away, away, away)
Just sit down, take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault (I know)
There's so much you have to go through (I have to make this decision)
Find a girl, settle down (Alone)
If you want you can marry
Look at me (No)
I am old, but I'm happy

[Verse 4: Son &amp; (Father)]
All the times that I've cried (Stay, stay, stay)
Keeping all the things I knew inside
It's hard
But it's harder to ignore it (Why must you go)
If they were right, I'd agree (And make this decision)
But it's them they know, not me (Alone)
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know, I have to go
[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la, la

[Verse 1]
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

[Verse 2]
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
Beware
[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl

[Bridge]
...la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la, la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la la la-la, la

Baby, I love you
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
(Beware)

[Extended Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And it's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
I listen to the wind
To the wind of my soul
Where I’ll end up well I think
Only God really knows

I’ve sat upon the settin' sun
But never, never, never, never
I never wanted water once
No, never, never, never

I listen to my words but
They fall far below
I let my music take me
Where my heart wants to go

I swam upon the devil’s lake
But never, never, never, never
I’ll never make the same mistake
No, never, never, never
Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the One Light Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word
Bring tea for the Tillerman
Steak for the Sun
Wine for the woman who made the rain come
Seagulls sing your hearts away
’Cause while the sinners sin
The children play
Oh Lord, how they play and play
For that happy day
For that happy day
I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's takin' almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
'Cause I'm sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, I'll try to love again
But baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest

Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
[Verse 1]
Now I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's going to come

Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

[Chorus]
Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
[Verse 2]
Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends, too
Because it's gettin' nearer
It soon will be with you

Now, come and join the livin'
It's not so far from you
And it's gettin' nearer
Soon it will all be true

[Chorus]
Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train

[Verse 3]
Now, I've been cryin' lately
Thinkin' about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating?
Why can't we live in bliss?
Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
[Chorus]
Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, come on, peace train
Yes, it's the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

[Verse 1]
And if I ever lose my hands
Lose my plough, lose my land
Oh if I ever lose my hands
Oh if, I won't have to work no more

[Verse 2]
And if I ever lose my eyes
If my colours all run dry
Yes if I ever lose my eyes
Oh if, I won't have to cry no more

[Chorus]
Yes, I am bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

[Verse 3]
And if I ever lose my legs
I won't moan, and I won't beg
Oh if I ever lose my legs
Oh if, I won't have to walk no more
[Verse 4]
And if I ever lose my mouth
All my teeth, north and south
Yes if I ever lose my mouth
Oh if, I won't have to talk

[Bridge]
Did it take long to find me?
I asked the faithful light
Oh, did it take long to find me?
And are you gonna stay the night?

[Chorus]
I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

[Outro]
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
[Verse 1]
Well I think it's fine
Building jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Yes, get what you want to if you want
'Cause you can get anything

[Chorus]
I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

[Verse 2]
Well, you roll on roads
Over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads
Pumping petrol gas
And you make them long
And you make them tough
But they just go on and on
And it seems that you can't get off

[Chorus]
Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

[Verse 3]
Well you've cracked the sky
Scrapers fill the air
But will you keep on building higher
'til there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh
Will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live
Will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?
I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who'll take me for myself
And if I find my hard headed woman
I won't need nobody else, no no no!

I'm looking for a hard headed woman (headed woman)
One who'll make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman
I know the rest of my life will be blessed yes (yes) yes yes

I know a lot of fancy dancers
Yes, people who can glide you on a floor
They move so smooth but have no answers
(Woah oh ho, woah ouh oh-oh-oh-oh)
When you ask them "What d'you come here for?"
"I don't know."
"Why?"

I know many fine feathered friends
But their friendliness depends on how you do
They know many sure fired ways
To find out the one who pays
And how you do

I'm looking for a hard-headed woman (headed woman)
One who will make me feel so good
And if I find my hard-headed woman
I know my life will be as it should - yes, yes, yes
I'm looking for a hard-headed woman (headed woman)
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman...
She hangs her head and cries on my shirt
She must be hurt very badly
Tell me what’s making you sad, Li?
Open your door, don’t hide in the dark
You’re lost in the dark, you can trust me
’Cause you know that’s how it must be

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain
Upon her pain getting deeper
Though my love wants to relieve her
She walks alone from wall to wall
Lost in a hall, she can’t hear me
Though I know she likes to be near me

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa

She sits in a corner by the door
There must be more I can tell her
If she really wants me to help her
I’ll do what I can to show her the way
And maybe one day I will free her
Though I know no one can see her

Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa
My Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
Yes, you will be my fill

My Lady d'Arbanville
Why does it grieve me so?
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low
Why do you breathe so low

My Lady d'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still?

And you will be my fill
Yes you will be my fill

My Lady d'Arbanville

I loved you my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die
This rose will never die

I loved you my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
But this rose will never die
This rose will never die
Trouble
Oh trouble set me free
I have seen your face
And it’s too much too much for me

Trouble
Oh trouble can’t you see
You’re eating my heart away
And there’s nothing much left of me

I’ve drunk your wine
You have made your world mine
So won’t you be fair
So won’t you be fair

I don’t want no more of you
So won’t you be kind to me
Just let me go where
I’ll have to go there

Trouble
Oh trouble move away
I have seen your face
And it’s too much for me today

Trouble
Oh trouble can’t you see
You have made me a wreck
Now won’t you leave me in my misery
I’ve seen your eyes
And I can see death’s disguise
Hangin’ on me
Hangin’ on me

I’m beat, I’m torn
Shattered and tossed and worn
Too shocking to see
Too shocking to see

Trouble
Oh trouble move from me
I have paid my debt
Now won’t you leave me in my misery

Trouble
Oh trouble please be kind
I don’t want no fight
And I haven’t got a lot of time
Ruby my love
You'll be my love
You'll be my sky above
Who'll be my light?

You'll be my day and night
You'll be mine tonight

Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door

Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door

I don't want no God on my lawn
Just a flower I can help along
'Cause the soul of nobody knows
How a flower grows
Oh, how a flower grows

Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
Mary dropped her pants by the sand
And let a parson come and take her hand
But the soul of nobody knows
Where the parson goes
Where does the parson go?

Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us
They're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore
They'll be taking the key from the door
Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now
They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim blue fading up to the sky

And though you want them to last forever
You know they never will
You know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you?
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven?

And though you want to last forever
You know you never will
You know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Will you carry the words of love with you?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
You're only dancing on this earth for a short while
Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
Well
If you want to sing out
Sing out
And if you want to be free
Be free
Cause there's a million things to be
You know that there are
And if you want to live high
Live high
And if you want to live low
Live low
Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are

You can do what you want
The opportunity's on
And if you find a new way

You can do it today
You can make it all true
And you can make it undo
You see
Ah
It's easy
Ah
You only need to know

Well
If you want to say yes
Say yes
And if you want to say no
Say no
Cause there's a million ways to go
You know that there are
And if you want to be me
Be me
And if you want to be you
Be you
Cause thee's a million things to do
You know that there are
Don't be shy, just let your feelings roll on by
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by

On by, on by, on by
On by, on by, on by
On by, on by, on by

You know love is better than a song
Love is where all of us belong
So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there

You're there, you're there, you're there
You're there, you're there, you're there
You're there, you're there, you're there

You don't be shy, just let your feelings roll on by
And don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead
No, don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by

On by, on by, on by
On by, on by, on by
On by, on by, on by
Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Look up at the mountain
I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there
Lord, my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end
Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

I creep through the valleys
And I grope through the woods
’Cause I know when I find it my honey
It’s gonna make me feel good, yes
I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’Cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, I’ll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it’s alright
I have my freedom
I can make my own rules
Oh yeah, the ones that I choose
Lord, my body has been a good friend
But I won’t need it when I reach the end
I love everything
So don’t it make you feel sad
’Cause I’ll drink to you, my baby
I’ll think to that, I’ll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Guess I’ll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Oh I'm on my way, I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair

Sitting on my own not by myself
Everybody's here with me
I don't need to touch your face to know
And I don't need to use my eyes to see

I keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I always wake up the same (or so)?
And keep on wondering if I sleep too long
Will I even wake up again or something

Oh I'm on my way I know I am
But times there were when I thought not
Bleeding half my soul in bad company
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop

I'm not making love to anyone's wishes
Only for that light I see
'Cause when I'm dead and lowered low in my grave
That's gonna be the only thing that's left of me

And if I make it to the waterside
Will I even find me a boat (or so)?
And if I make it to the waterside
I'll be sure to write you note or something
Oh I'm on my way I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair

Oh life is like a maze of doors and they all
Open from the side you're on
Just keep on pushing hard boy, try as you may
You're going to wind up where you started from
You're going to wind up where you started from
How can I tell you that I love you, I love you
But I can’t think of right words to say
I long to tell you that I’m always thinking of you
I’m always thinking of you, but my words
Just blow away, just blow away
It always ends up to one thing, honey
And I can’t think of right words to say
Wherever I am girl, I’m always walking with you
I’m always walking with you, but I look and you’re not there
Whoever I’m with, I’m always, always talking to you
I’m always talking to you, and I’m sad that
You can’t hear, sad that you can’t hear
It always ends up to one thing, honey
When I look and you’re not there
I need to know you, need to feel my arms around you
Feel my arms around you, like a sea around a shore
And -- each night and day I pray, in hope
That I might find you, in hope that I might
Find you, because heart’s can do no more
It always ends up to one thing honey, still I kneel upon the floor
How can I tell you that I love you, I love you
But I can’t think of right words to say
I long to tell you that I’m always thinking of you
I’m always thinking of you....
It always ends up to one thing honey
And I can’t think of right words to say
Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out
I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out
Well, I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there
Many stories told me of the way to get there
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to find out

Well in the end I’ll know, but on the way I wonder
Through descending snow, and through the frost and
Thunder
I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to hurry
I listen to the robin’s song saying not to worry
So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know, and I’m on the road to
Findout

Then I found myself alone
Hoping someone would miss me
Thinking about my home
And the last woman to kiss me, kiss me
But sometimes you have to moan
When nothing seems to suit yer
But nevertheless you know
You’re locked towards the future
So on and on you go
The seconds tick the time out
There’s so much left to know
And I’m on the road to findout

Then I found my head one day when I wasn’t even trying
And here I have to say, ’cause there is no use in lying, lying
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil’s sin, pick up, pick up a good book now
Up at eight, you can't be late
For Matthew and Son, he won't wait
Watch them run down to platform one
And the eight thirty train to Matthew & Son

Matthew and Son, the work's never done
There's always something new
The files in your head, you take them to bed
You're never, ever, through
And they've been workin' all day, all day, all day

There's a five minute break and that's all you take
For a cup of cold coffee and a piece of cake

Matthew and Son, the work's never done
There's always something new
The files in your head, you take them to bed
You're never, ever, through
And they've been workin' all day, all day, all day

He's got people who've been workin' for fifty years
No one asks for more money cause nobody dares
Even though they're pretty low and their rent's in arrears

Matthew and Son, Matthew and Son
Matthew and Son, Matthew and Son
And they've been workin' all day, all day, all day

Matthew and Son
Matthew and Son
Matthew and Son
Matthew and Son
In the midnight moonlight
I'll be walkin' a long and lonely mile
And every time I do
I keep seein' this picture of you

Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And that comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love that's all so fine
Never could be mine, no matter how I try

You never walk alone
And you're forever talkin' on the phone
I've tried to call you names
But every time it comes out the same

Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And that comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love that's all so fine
Never could be mine, no matter how I try

I'm still waitin' for your heart
Cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
You'll be mine to hold each day
But till then this is all that I can say
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And that comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
Here comes my baby, here she comes now
Walkin' with a love, with a love that's all so fine
Never could be mine, no matter how I try

Here comes my baby, here she comes now
And that comes as no surprise to me, with another guy
Here comes my baby
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I got in town a month ago
I've seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet em I can get em, but as yet I haven't met em
Thats how I'm in the state I'm in

Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Oh, no, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I've got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I'm in an awful way (He's in an awful way)
I'm in an awful way, oooh, I'm in an awful way
(He's in an awful way)
I love my dog
As much as I love you
You may fade
My dog will always come through

All he asks from me
Is the food to give him strength
All he ever needs
Is love and that he knows he'll get

So, I love my dog
As much as I love you
You may fade
My dog will always come through

All the pay I need comes
Shining through his eyes
I don't need no cold water
To make me realize that

I love my dog
As much as I love you
You may fade
My dog will always come through

Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana

I love my dog
As much as I love you
You may fade
My dog will always come through

Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana

I love my dog, baby
I love my dog, na, na, na
I love my dog, baby
I love my dog, na, na, na
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
Tables of paper wood, windows of light
And everything emptying into white

A simple garden, with acres of sky
A brown-haired dog-mouse if one dropped by
Yellow delanie would sleep well at night
With everything emptying into white

A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside
A black spider dancing on top of his eye
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike
And everything emptying into white

I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice

And everything emptying into white
I don’t want to work away
Doing just what they all say
"Work hard boy and you’ll find
One day you’ll have a job like mine"
’cause I know for sure
Nobody should be that poor
To say 'yes' or sink low
Because you happen to say so, say so, you say so

I don’t want to work away
Doing just what they all say
"Work hard boy and you’ll find
Job like mine, job like mine, a job like mine."

"Be wise, look ahead
Use your eyes", he said
"Be straight, think right"
But I might die tonight!
I was raised in Babylon
Our priests taught us how to worship the sun
Wo! Where did we go wrong?
They used to call us civilised – but those days are gone

I came to guard the Pharaoh
Bring him wine and women
Oh Lord! Where is he now?
We used call him the highest – till the wave took him down

I was born in the Holy Land
They told me it was by God's command
Wo! Where are the others from?
I thought that we were the chosen – I must've been wrong

I loved to march with the Sultan
And his diamond turban
Oh Lord! Then the world took hold
Let go of the rope of God – for a handful of gold

I used to serve the Empire
On which the sun set, never
Oh! Now times have turned
We thought our white skins would save us –
Then we got burned
Oh, I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out
I've got to show the world, world's got to see
See all the love, love that's in me

I said, why walk alone?
Why worry when it's warm over here?
You've got so much to say, say what you mean
Mean what you're thinking, think anything

Oh why, why must you waste you're life away?
You've got to live for today, then let it go, oh
Lover, I want to spend this time with you
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know

And I can't keep it in
I can't hide it and I can't lock it away
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love

No, I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out
I've gotta show the world, world's got to know
Know of the love, love that lies low

So why can't you say?
If you know, then why can't you say?
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light
Light has to shine, I said shine light, shine light
Love, that's no way to live your life
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do, no
Lover, I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you

An' I can't keep it in
I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out
I've got to show the world, world's got to see
See all the love, love that's in me

I said, why walk alone?
Now why worry when it's warm over here?
You've got so much to say, say what you mean
Mean what you're thinking, think anything, why not?
Now, why, why, why not?
Wish I could watch them jumping round, calling names
Kicking cans and playing tag, hide in every place
Wish I could see them now, and even join in their games
How different life would be, but I've got no time for silly chitter-chatter
I'm on my way
That's why my blood's still warm and I'm not getting better
Time's passing away
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow

Wish I could buy them toys, rubber balls and trains
Watch them see how tall they grow, make it day by day
Oh I want nothing more, than to see them laugh and play
Life would be so different then, but I've got no time for silly chitter-chatter
I'm on my way
'Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter
I'm going to pray
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow

That we got no time for silly chitter-chatter
I'm on my way
'Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter
I'm hoping to stay
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow
If I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the chance
That I didn’t have to know you
And live in peace, in peace

If I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the plans that
I didn’t use to get you
At home with me alone

If I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can recall the way
That I used to be, before you
And sleep at night and dream
If I laugh, baby if I laugh
Just a little bit
If I make a mark in time
Then I can't say the mark is mine
I'm only the underline of the word
Yes, I'm like him
Just like you
An' I can't tell you what to do
Like everybody else
I'm searchin' through, what I've heard

Woah, where do you go
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow
Tuesday's dead?

Oh Preacher, won't you paint my dream?
Won't you show me where you've been?
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind
Cause I will learn to understand
If I have a helpin' hand
I wouldn't make another demand all my life

Woah, where do you go
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow
Tuesday's dead?

What's my sex, what's my name?
All in all, it's all the same
Everybody plays a different game, that is all
Now, man may live, man may die
Searchin' for the question, "Why"
But if he tries to rule the sky, he must fall

Woah, where do you go
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow
Tuesday's dead?

Now every second on the nose
(Woah)
The humdrum of the city grows
(Woah, woah)
Reachin' out beyond the throes of our time
(Woah)
We must try to shake it down
(Woah)
Do our best to break the ground
(Woah, woah)
Try to turn the world around one more time
(Woah)
Yea, we must try to shake it down
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time

Woah, where do you go
When you don't want no one to know?
Who told tomorrow
Tuesday's dead?
A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way
On the day I was to wed
It is you who I wish to share
My body with she said

We'll find a dry place under the sky
With a flower for a bed
And for my joy I will give you a boy
With a moon and star... on his head.

Her silver hair flowed in the air
Laying waves across the sun
Her hands were like the white sands
And her eyes had diamonds on

We left the road and headed up
To the top of the whisper wood
And we walked till we came to where
The holy magnolia stood

And there we laid cool in the shade
Singing songs and making love
With the naked earth beneath us
And the universe above

The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait
I was sad but I had to go
So while she was asleep
I kissed her cheek for cheerio

The wedding took place and people came
From many miles around
There was plenty merriment
Cider and wine abound

But out of all that I recall
I remembered the girl I met
'Cause she had given me something
That my heart could not forget

Lah la la la la la
La-la-la la la la
La-la-la-la-laa la-laa
La-laa la-laaa

A year had passed and everything was just
As it was a year before, as if was a year before
Until the gift that someone left
A basket by my door

And in there lay
The fairest little baby crying to be fed
I got down on my knees and kissed
The moon and star... on his head

As years went by the boy grew high
And the village looked on in awe
They'd never seen anything like the boy
With the moon and star before

And people would ride from far and wide
Just to seek the word he spread
I'll tell you everything I've learned
And love is all... he said

La la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la, la la la la, la la la
La-la-la, la la, la la la la
I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
No bitterblue
Yes, I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue
My bitterblue

Yes, I've been running a long time
On this travelling ground
Wishing hard to be free
Of going round and round
Yeah, yes I've been moving a long time
But only up and down

I gave my last hope to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
My bitterblue
I've done all one man can do
Please help me lose this bitterblue
My bitterblue

'Cause I've been waiting a long time
Aeons been and gone
Looking at the horizon
For my light to dawn
Oh yes I've been running a long time
Looking on and on
I've been running a long time
Summers come and gone
Oh, drifting under the dream clouds
Past the broken sun
Oh yes I've been living a long time
To be back beyond

I gave my last hope to you
Don't hand it back bitterblue
Oh, my bitterblue
I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up oh, bitterblue

My bitterblue, oh my bitterblue
Yeah, my bitterblue, oh my bitterblue
Oh bitterblue, yeah
I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
You can do whatever you want to do
Anything you want, you can do
You can ride a tiger or walk the dock
Anything you wish can be true
You can watch the world as it passes by
And you can make it stop for you

You can stay at home or brave a storm
When the blizzard blows
You can dance around in the rain or
Watch from the window
You can lay in bed and do nothing or
Rise and shine
You can take whatever comes around but please don't take what's mine

You can do whatever you want to do
Anything you want, you can do
You can say whatever you wish to say
But if you do that make it true
You can chase a dream in the black of night
But you can make it walk to you

You can treat the world like a piece of dust
Or a pot of gold
You can be a child in your heart or you can grow old
You can laise around in your jeans or put on a suit
You can be the boss of the company, or just join the queue
You can close your eyes to the dark or make it bright
You can stop the wrongs of the world and you can make it right
And you can hide at home when the soldiers start to march out
You can listen to what they say, or you can shout
Slowly let me tell you a story of a tree, an apple tree

Once in a summertime garden lived a little apple tree
And the man who owned it wanted it to be picked
And so he sent forth to hire me

Well, I've traveled the mountains and I've traveled the sea
But a never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me

Laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple
Autumn is waiting, you'd better be careful
And it will bring you down if it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple

Well, all the apples were hiding
Frightened that they might be plucked
And every time that somebody passed
All except that one little apple ducked

Well, I've traveled the mountains and I've traveled the sea
But a never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me

Laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple
Autumn is waiting, you'd better be careful
And it will bring you down if it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple

Laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple
Autumn is waiting, you'd better be careful
For it will bring you down if it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, oh laugh, laughing apple
Don’t you feel a change a coming
From another side of time
Breaking down the walls of silence
Lifting shadows from your mind
Placing back the missing mirrors
That before you couldn’t find
Filling mysteries of emptiness
That yesterday left behind

And we all know it’s better
Yesterday has past
Now let’s all start the living
For the one that’s going to last
And we all know it’s better
Yesterday has past
Now let’s all start the living
For the one that’s going to last

Don’t you feel the day is coming
That will stay and remain
When your children see the answers
That you saw the same
When the clouds have all gone
There will be no more rain
And the beauty of all things
Is uncovered again
Don’t you feel the day is coming
And it won’t be too soon
When the people of the world
Can all live in one room
When we shake off the ancient
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb
We will all be born again
Of the eternal womb
Now that I've passed your test
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down?
If I led you around, I'm sorry but I never meant to worry you know

Now that I've kissed your breast
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad
If I ever had, do believe your tears tears won't come back again

I love you, though the stars may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you till my body changes into an old man
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

La la la la la la
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead
Anything that Heaven can give you, I can give you instead

La la la la la la
How could I lie to you baby? I'll never lead you around
I'll take care of everything you need, darling every little need will be found

I love you though the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea
And I really only want you to want me
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Now that you've shown your heart
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold

And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love
Flying on the power of love

I love you, though time may fade and mountains turn into sand
I love you, till the very same come back to the land
I love you and the song that I sing
Is the only way that I can explain

Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other
Two fine people should love each other
Two fine people should help each other
Now I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's going to come
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Now I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on the peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Come on the peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends too
'Cause it's getting nearer
It soon will be with you
Now come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on the peace train
Peace train
Now I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating
Why can't we live in bliss
'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Oh, peace train sounding louder
Glide on the peace train
Come on the peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump upon the peace train
Come on, come on, come on
Yes, come on the peace train
Yes, it's a peace train
Come on the peace train
Oh peace train
Back upon the mended road I pause
Taking time to check the dial
And the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again

I raise my hand and touch the wheel of change
Taking time to check the dial
And the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again
She'll be passing my way sometime again
She moves like an angel
And seven evening stars
Dance through the windows
Of her universal house
Of her universal house

Her voice, a crystal echo
Lies humming in your soul
So patiently awaiting
For your ears to behold
For your ears to behold

She ripples on the water
Leaves diamonds on the shore
And fish from every distance
Watch her ocean cellar door

Her breath, a warm fire
In every lovers heart
A mistress to magicians
And a dancer to the Gods
And a dancer to the Gods

Her clothes are made of rainbows
And twenty thousand tears
Shine through the spaces
Of her golden ocher hair
Yes, of her golden ocher hair

My babe, I want you
And on my life, I swear
My conscience will follow you forever
If you meet me everywhere
Yes, if you meet me everywhere

She moves like an angel
And seven evening stars
Dance through the windows
Of her universal house
Yes, of her universal house
Of her universal house
[Verse 1]
Once upon a lighting horse
Riding through the universe
Shedding light upon a thousand doors
Time stood still
On the olive hill

[Verse 2]
On his back the prophet sat
Open-eyed not looking back
'Til they reach the sacred land
Time stood still
On the olive hill

[Verse 3]
There upon a golden square
All the prophets joined in prayer
And the stars fell silent everywhere
Time stood still
On the olive hill

[Bridge]
Then the heavenly ascent
Past the place where no soul went
This one soul was welcomed in
Time stood still
On the olive hill
[Verse 4]
Then the tale began to spread
Some would say he's lost his head
But for those who trusted
Light would spill
Around the olive hill
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh

My trail is blazing
Smoke overhead
My trail is blazing
Smoke everywhere

I feel amazing
Love, it be rare

I was a strong man
Strong as can be
I was a strong man
Strong as a tree

Come back and see
What love did to me

Just like the wind
My heart's rushing fast
A piece of dust
Too hard to catch

A raging flood
A way to see
A raging flood
Rolling madly

Come back and see
What love did to me

I was a child
Lost in the dark
I was a child
Missing in the dark

A broken arrow
Missing the mark

I tread the night were
Stalking a dream
I place the night were
Stalking a dream

Wake up and see
What love did to me

I was a blindfolded bumblebee
I was a blindfolded bumblebee

And now I see
What God did for me
He made me see life
Flowery

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh
I sit beside the dark
Beneath the mire
Cold grey dusty day
The morning lake
Drinks up the sky

Katmandu I’ll soon be seeing you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down

Chop me some broken wood
We’ll start a fire
White warm light the dawn
And help me see
Old satan’s tree

Katmandu I’ll soon be touching you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down

Pass me my hat and coat
Lock up the cabin
Slow night treat me right
Until I go
Be nice to know
Katmandu I’ll soon be seeing you
And your strange bewildering time
Will keep me home
In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt
I'm alone and there is no one by my side

In the blackness of the night
I see a shadow passing by
From the heels of an old soldier boy
There's no compromising
And his eyes are black as the sky
For this bad, bad world he is going to die
He's alone and there is no one by his side

In the blackness of the night
I see a sparkle of a star
From the sweet silver tear of a child
And she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago
When her parents were happy she was too young to know
She's alone and there is no one by her side

I'm alone and there is no one by my side

In the blackness of the night
I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt
I'm alone, and there is no one by my side
The saga the Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long
Yeah saga the Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long

Yes, I've got my reasons and to me they're all true
And I wouldn't change them, not even for you
The saga the Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaaaah
Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Yeaah, yeaaah, yeah-yeah-yeaaaaah
Yeaaaaaaaaah
Ooooh wuooooooh now!
Yeeees, so much
Mmmmmmh...


[ Cat Stevens ]
Don't blame the girl
She won't do you wrong
The veil she wears on her long dark hair, Mary would have done

Don't blame the boy
He won't do you wrong
The fist he shakes at the giant's face, David would have done

Beware
If you turn to face your fears
It will disappear, like it wasn't there

Don't blame them
They're just an illusion
Why chase the ghosts outside
Turn and see between your eyes
There stands the one you hide

So wait
Understand the world you hate
And go where the plate
Love will know the rate

Don't blame the child, and don't blame the men
Don't blame us and don't blame them
Don't blame her, and don't blame him
Don't blame the world, and don't blame time
Don't blame the weather if it don't shine
Don't blame the sun if it makes you blind
Don't blame the stars that you can't touch
Don't blame the food if you gobble too much
Don't blame money if it don't grow
Don't blame the river if it don't flow
Don't blame the people that you don't know
Don't blame people who tell you to
'Cause in the end they're gonna blame you
Sun is the reason
And the world it will bloom
'Cause sun lights the sky
And the sun lights the moon

Sun is the reason
All the happy trees are green
And who can explain
The light in your dream

Sit you down, sit you down young gentleman
There's something I want you to know
You keep on asking me
You keep on asking me why, why are we here?
It started a long time ago
Me and your Mum on the night
Yeah yeah yeah, we met

I was on the road again
She was in C79
I'll never, never forget
I'll never forget that night, no no

We met in a back road behind the stage
She had the best figure by far
A thousand hours I've looked at her eyes
But I still don't know what color they are
Me and your Mum on the night
Oh Lord, we met

I was on the road again
She was in C79
She was a junkie then
And I was having a good time
Back on the road again

Oh Momma I was on the road again
Back in suite 79
I'll never never forget
I'll never forget that time
Back on the road again
Oh I'm traveling that line
I was a pop star then
I'm still having a good time
People, do you understand me now
If sometimes I feel a little mad
Don't you know no one alive can
Always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem a little sad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Sometimes seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more
Than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
I don't mean it

People, don't you know I'm only human
Don't you know I have faults like any one
But sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little thing; some foolish thing
That I have done
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just someone whose intentions are good
Don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood
There are no words, I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

Dreams I had just last night
Made me scared, white with fright
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

Fortunes come and fortunes go
But things get better babe, that's one thing I know
And I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

I have a friend that I have met
Who gives me love and a certain respect
Just a little respect, everybody needs just a little respect
That means you. . .you...

And in a little while our love will spread
To you
Ain't no matter who inside this world you know
There'll he someone who will love you just for who you are
Really are

Dreams I had just last night
Made me worried to face up to the light
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

Oh darling, you see my face
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste
Can you ...

Oh love, sweet blue love
No man can ever get enough
But maybe one day we'll all die in love
Will you . . Oh love, sweet love, my... love

Oh babe, understand
Take my love that's all I have at hand
Please say you will ... Don't say you can't
Oh Will you Will you Will you

The moment you walked inside my door
I knew' that I need not look no more
I've seen many other girls before, ah but darling
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realised all I had not seen
I've seen many other girls before, ah hot darling
Heaven must've programmed you

You can live in the largest house
And eleven apartments too
Run your own private plane
And a boat in Malibu

But 'till you know' deep down what inside you really need
Well I love you baby, Ooh my dear
And I think about you sometimes
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind

Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you were born to do'?
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you
Love, love boy...
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night

Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh
Cos you've been a saving grace to me
And I'd hate to face a day without you around
My life would be without sound

Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday
Cos you taste to me as good as God made honey taste babe
And the sky all glistens with gold
When you're talking to me
And the whirling wind turns to song
Why it sets my soul free

Love, love. love. love must've made you on a Sunday

There are no words. I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you
You say you want to seek the truth
But it's hard to find, no one to help you
Your friends don't have the time

So you ride around in your car
Switch on the radio, you want to relate to
Something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look

Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face gray
Until I got hurt, till got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know' what love is

You say you want to learn to laugh
Cause music makes you cry
But the tears you shed are only in your eye

So you turn to any phony mouth
With a tale to tell but he's just a hoaxer
Don't you know selling peace and religion
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum

Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I did not know what to do
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is
Young son, don't let me down, young son
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now
Hold on, never let go, now hold on
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way

Cause till you make that final show
You'll never know what love
You've been missing, missing

You say you want to seek the truth
But you work alone, no one to help you
And nobody to push you on

So you sit at home drinking your wine
Television on, you wait for a miracle
Cause you say one day one will come along
But wishful thinking, boy any minute now you might be gone
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong

So until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is, oh no

Until I got hurt, oh I didn't know what love is
Getting hung up all day on smiles
Walking down portobello road for miles
Greeting strangers in Indian boots
Yellow ties and old brown suits
Growing old is my only danger

Cuckoo clocks, and plastic socks
Lampshades of old antique leather
Nothing looks weird, not even a beard
Or the boots made out of feathers

I'll keep walking miles 'til I feel
A broom beneath my feet
Or the hawking eyes of an
Old stuffed bull across the street

Nothings the same if you see it again
It'll be broken down to litter
Oh, and the clothes
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her

Getting hung up all day on smiles
Walking down portobello road for miles
Greeting strangers in Indian boots
Yellow ties and old brown suits
Growing old is my only danger

Cuckoo clocks, and plastic socks
Lampshades of old antique leather
Nothing looks weird, not even a beard
Or the boots made out of feathers

I'll keep walking miles 'til I feel
A broom beneath my feet
Or the hawking eyes of an
Old stuffed bull across the street

Nothing's the same if you see it again
It'll be broken down to litter
Oh, and the clothes
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her

Getting hung up all day on smiles
Walking down portobello road for miles
Greeting strangers in Indian boots
Yellow ties and old brown suits
Growing old is my only danger
Ouh yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
What makes me, me, what makes you, you
It's just another point of view, (Ooooooh)
A state of mind I'm going through, (Yeaaaaah)
So what I see is never true
(Aaaaaah ah ah ah)

I wish I'll tell, I wish I'll tell
What makes a heaven, what makes a hell
And do I get to ring my bell, (Ooooooh)
Or land up in some dusty cell, (Nooooooo)
While others reach the big hotel
(Yeaaaaaaah eah eah eah)

I wish I had, I wish I had
The secret of good, and the secret of bad
Why does this question drive me mad? (Aaaaaah)
'Cause I was taught when but a lad, (Yeaaaaaah)
That bad was good and good was bad
(Nooooooo oh oh oh)

I wish I knew the mystery of
That thing called hate, and that thing called love
What makes the in-between so rough? (Aaaaaaaah)
Why is it always push and shove? (Aaaaaaaah)
I guess I just don't know enough
(Yeaaaaaaah eah eah eah)

Yeah yeaaaaah, yeah, yeaaaah
Yeah yeaaaaah, yeah, yeaaaah
Yeah, yeaaah, yeah
Yeah, yeaaah, yeah

I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew

Somebody tell me, (Somebody tell me)
Ohh, ohh
Somebody tell me, (Somebody tell me)
You know I've heard it said there's beauty in distortion
By some people who've withdrawn to find their heads
Now they say that there is humor in misfortune
You know I wonder if they'll laugh when they are dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
You know some people say that values are subjective
But they're just speaking words that someone else has said
And so they live and fight and kill with no objective
Sometimes it's hard to tell the living from the dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
You know I used to weave my words into confusion
And so I hope you'll understand me when I'm through
You know I used to live my life as an illusion
But reality will make my dream come true
So I'll keep fighting to live till there's no reason to fight
And I'll keep trying to see until the end is in sight
You know I'm trying to give so c'mon give me a try
You know I'm dying to live until I'm ready to die
Until I'm ready
Until God takes me...
Now maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more
I've done it for too long
It was getting so good
Why then, where did it go?
I can't think about it no more
Tell me if you know
You were loving me
I was loving you
But now there ain't nothing but regretting
Nothing, nothing but regretting
Everything we do

I put up with your lies
Like you put up with mine
But God knows we should have stopped somewhere
We could have taken the time
But time has turned
Yes, some call it the end
So tell me, tell me did you really love me
Like a friend?
You know you don't have to pretend
It's all over now
It'll never happen again, no no no
It'll never happen again
It won't happen again
Never, never never
It'll never happen again
No, no no-no
No, no, no, no

So maybe you're right
And maybe you're wrong
But I ain't gonna argue with you no more
I've done it for too long
It was getting so good
Why then, where did it go?
I can't think about it no more
Tell me if you know
You were loving me
I was loving you
But now there ain't nothing but regretting
Nothing, nothing but regretting
Everything we do
Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go
It followed her most every day, and it made the people laugh
You'd never see it work or play, and you'd never see it at the grass
Oh they'll be loving a long long time from now, but it'll be too late for him
Oh they'll be kissing and hugging and holding tight, but it'll be too late for him

And people tried to talk to him, but it never made no sense
'Cause just as they were getting through, it'd be jumping another fence
It'd follow in her footsteps, and everywhere she went
It'd see him in there with her, but you'd never be seeing him
Oh they'll be loving a long long time from now, but it'll be too late for him
Yes they'll be kissing and hugging and holding tight, but it'll be too late for him

Now one dark day, a big storm came
And it blew Mary's house away
All the walls had vanished, and there was nowhere for Mary to stay
She cried and cried, and looked around
But everything was gone
Except for that one little lamb
He was still holding on

Oh they'll be loving a long long time from now, but there'll be noone more happy than him
'Cause every night, the moon shines bright, and she'll be cuddling up to him
They'll be loving a long long time from now, but there'll be noone more happy than him
'Cause every night, the stars shine bright, and she'll be cuddling up to him
[Chorus]
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy

[Verse 1]
Soon I'm gonna slip away in the night
I feel it creeping, creeping, creeping

[Chorus]
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a book I read
And imagine it was a feather bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy

[Verse 2]
I can't keep my mind away from my dreams
I hear them calling, calling, calling

[Bridge]
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
In the night I'm gonna slip away
I won't fight it
I'll just ride it

[Chorus]
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy, yeah
How I'd love to be a child, with friends spread all around me
Playing games and running wild, with nothing more to do than to
Watch the sun make light, and watch the moon take over
From the day into the night, what mighty peace I'd find

How I'd love to be a cloud, floating high above
All the people rushing round, with nothing more to do
And to make the rain come down, and watch the colors change
On the Earth to green from brown, what mighty peace I'd find

Haha
They used to call Him Jesus, long time ago
They're still calling Him Jesus, don't you know?
They crossed the wood and hanged Him a long time ago
They still misunderstand Him those who don't know
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
In every secret corner there in your mind

They called Him Gautama Buddha, oh long time ago
He turned the world to order, don't you know?
He used to sit knowing oh long time ago
Where you and me were going
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

You were my sweet love, my first sweet love
My lovey dove my love, lovey dove
No matter what place, whichever the place
I still see your face, your smiling face

In childish dreams, inside my dreams
Like King and Queen, God save our dreams
N'though time may face, though time may fade
It ain't never too late to learn about love
Learn about love
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

You were my sweet love, my first sweet love
My lovey dove my love, lovey dove
No matter what place, whichever the place
I still see your face, your smiling face

In childish dreams, inside my dreams
Like King and Queen, God save our dreams
N'though time may face, though time may fade
It ain't never too late to learn about love
Learn about love
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you
And in the morning when you fill my eyes
I knew that day I couldn't do
Ah ah-ah, no wrong, I couldn't do

And so my mind begins to memorize
'Cause time will never seem the same
Ah ah-ah, no more, never again

I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go
My legs are weak my heels are low
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll
Can't make no headway on this road

There's an empty space inside me now
A wasteland deep beneath the snow
So cold, nothing will grow

I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go
My legs are weak my heels are low
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll
Can't make no headway on this road
What road?

And in the morning when you fill my eyes
I knew that day I couldn't do
Ah ah-ah, no wrong, I couldn't do
There is a wind by Billy and it's awful strong
Come for you and anyone who's helped you along
But I want to live, live, live and let the stars shine bright
Yes I want to live, live, live and let it hum all right
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
I don't want to fight it, Billy 'cause I want to go
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowing up a southern change
And a northern wind's really making me feel kind of strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowing up a southern change
And a northern wind's really making me feel kind of strange

And where this gun rolls, everything I want to say
Not for you but anyone who takes it away
Let it fill his life, life, life until there's nothing left
Let it kill his wife's love until he goes to bed
And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
I don't want to fight it, Billy 'cause I want to go
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowing up a southern change
And a northern wind's really making me feel kind of strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowing up a southern change
And a northern wind's really making me feel kind of strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowing up a southern change
When I hold your hand I could fly a zillion miles with you
When I see your grace I can see you're God's words come true
Every little bird above the haze and fish beneath the waves
Knows about you, wouldn't they do

When I see your eyes I can see rainbows in the sky
Being with you all who parted reunite
Every little pearl drop in the clouds and stones beneath the ground
Are waiting for you, wouldn't they do

Whatever you say lightens up the burden of the day
Whatever you do makes us ever want to follow you
Whatever they say, whatever they do
I'll always love you

Every burning comet that zooms and angels too
Think about you, wouldn't they do

Thinkin' 'bout you I could climb a mountain in the dark
Listenin' to you flowers dance in the park
Whatever they say, whatever they do
We'll always love you

The words that you say lightens up the burdens of the day
Whatever you do makes us wanna follow you
Whatever they say, whatever they do
I'll always love you
Hunc ornatum mundi
Nolo perdere
Video flagrare
Omnia res
Audio clamare
Homines
Nune extinguitur
Mundi et astrorum lamen
Nune concipitur
Mali hominis crimen
Tristetate et lacrimis
Gravis est dolor
De terraeque maribus
Magnus est clamor
O caritas, O caritas
Nobis semper sit amor
Mos perituri mortem salutamus
Sola resurgit vita
Ah, this world is burning fast
Oh, the world will never last
I don't want to lost it here in my time
Give me time forever here in my time
I know I think a lot
But somehow it just doesn't help
It only makes it worse
The more I think
The more I know
The more it hurts

With only solitude
To meet me like a friend
Oh, where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Maybe she sits alone
Beyond the storm
Across the raging torrent of the sea
She knows I want her
And she knows I'll always be

How can I live without the love
I cannot see
Oh where are you?
Where are you ?
Where are you?

I know there's someone there
I hear her breathe
Behind the silence of the dark
But I know that I won't see
'Til we open up our eyes together
She'll look at me
What a moment that moment will be

And she looks so light
I could fly her through the night

I know I think a lot
But somehow it just doesn't help
It only goes to show
That what you never miss
You never know

But I have loved you from the moment
That we knew
Oh, I love you
I love you
But where are you?
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yes
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah
I love, I love, I'm ready to, ready to, ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah

You keep me awake with your white lily smile
Don't keep me watching your charms all the while
'Cause as all the wise men say
"Grab it if it comes your way"

I'm ready to love, yes
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah

Ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah

You make me feel things I've never felt before
Help my baby eyes and open up the door
You make me real to everyone and everyday
I, I thank the Lord that you came along this way
It's no more an illusion than I can say

I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yes

I love, I love, I'm ready, ready, ready, ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to, ready to, ready to love
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah
I love, I love, I'm ready to, ready to, ready to love
Right now
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yes
I love, I love, I'm ready to love, yeah yes
Yeah, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, ready, ready, ready to love
Silent sunlight, welcome in
There is work I must now begin
All my dreams have blown away
And the children want to play
They'll soon remember things to do
When the heart is young
And the night is done
And the sky is blue

Morning songbird, sing away
Lend a tune to another day
Bring your wings and choose a roof
Sing a song of love and truth
We'll soon remember if you do
When all things were tall
And our friends were small
And the world was new

Sleepy horses, heave away
Put your backs to the golden hay
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done
For your work has just begun
There'll be the evening in the end
But till that time arrives
You can rest your eyes
And begin again
The moment you walked inside my door
I knew that I need not look no more
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realized all I had not seen
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

Oh will you? Will you? Will you?
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes

And if you walk along and if you lose your way
Don't forget the one who gave you this today

Follow True Love, follow True Love
Follow True Love, follow True Love

Oh will you? Will you? Will you?
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
And if a storm should come and if you face away
That may be the chance for you to be safe
And if you make it through the trouble and the pain
That may be the time for you to know his name

The moment you walked inside my door
I knew that I need not look no more
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realized all I had not seen
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you said "I will"
I knew that this love was real
And that my faith was seen - oh
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment I looked into your eyes
I knew that they told no lies
There would be no good byes - Ah
'cause Heaven must've programmed you

I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
[Intro]
Slowly
Let me tell you a story
Lover tree
An apple tree

[Verse 1]
Once in a summertime garden
Lived a little apple tree
And the man who owned it
Wanted it to be picked
And so he sent for to hire me

[Pre Chorus]
Well I've traveled the mountains
And I've traveled the sea
But never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me

[Chorus]
So laugh, laugh a little apple
Autumn is waiting
You better be careful
And it'll bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, laugh a little apple
[Verse 2]
Well all the apples were hiding
Frightened that they might be plucked
And every time somebody passed
All except that one little apple ducked

[Pre Chorus]
Well I've traveled the mountains
And I've traveled the sea
But never in my traveling days
Have I ever seen a little apple smile at me

[Chorus]
Laugh, laugh a little apple
Autumn is waiting
You better be careful
And it'll bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, laugh a little apple
Laugh, laugh a little apple
Autumn is waiting
You better be careful
And it'll bring you down
If it ever sees you wearing a frown
So laugh, laugh a little apple
There are no words, I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

Dreams I had just last night
Made me scared, white with fright
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

Fortunes come and fortunes go
But things get better babe, that's one thing I know
And I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

I have a friend that I have met
Who gives me love and a certain respect
Just a little respect, everybody needs just a little respect
That means you. . .you...

And in a little while our love will spread
To you
Ain't no matter who inside this world you know
There'll he someone who will love you just for who you are
Really are

Dreams I had just last night
Made me worried to face up to the light
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

You can live in the largest house
And eleven apartments too
Run your own private plane
And a boat in Malibu

But 'till you know' deep down what inside you really need
Well I love you baby, Ooh my dear
And I think about you sometimes
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind

Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people would say
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them away
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you were born to do'?
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom for you
Love, love boy...
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night
Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh
Cos you've been a saving grace to me
And I'd hate to face a day without you around
My life would be without sound

Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday
Cos you taste to me as good as God made honey taste babe
And the sky all glistens with gold
When you're talking to me
And the whirling wind turns to song
Why it sets my soul free

Love, love. love. love must've made you on a Sunday

There are no words. I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

Oh darling, you see my face
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste
Can you ...

Oh love, sweet blue love
No man can ever get enough
But maybe one day we'll all die in love
Will you . .. Oh love, sweet love, my... love
Oh babe, understand
Take my love that's all I have at hand
Please say you will ... Don't say you can't
Oh Will you Will you Will you

The moment you walked inside my door
I knew' that I need not look no more
I've seen many other girls before, ah but darling
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realised all I had not seen
I've seen many other girls before, ah hot darling
Heaven must've programmed you
I used to trust nobody
Trusting even less their words
Until I found somebody
There was no one I preferred
My heart was made of stone
My eyes saw only misty grey
Until you came into my life girl
I saw everyone that way
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life

I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight

So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine

I used to walk alone
Every step seemed the same
This world was not my home
So there was nothing much to gain
Look up and see the clouds
Look down and see the cold floor
Until you came into my life girl
I saw nothing, nothing more
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life
I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight

So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine

I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight

So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Baby, I've never had a single thing in my life
That I could call my own
There you were, holding a love so true
Now I've got a home, now I've got a home

I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
I found a love, baby
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
Hidden away from the world, baby

Baby, you really make me feel like a king
A king without a crown
But darlin', promise me one little thing
That you won't let me down, you won't let me down

I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
I found a love, baby
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
Hidden away from the world, baby

Don't ever tell me lies baby
Don't take it for a ride baby
Just stay here by my side baby
We won't ever stop

I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
I found a love, baby
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
Hidden away from the world, baby
I found a love, hidden in a backstreet
I found a love, baby
O Allah, send Your peace on Your slave, Muhammad
O Allah, send Your blessings on Your beloved
O Allah, send Your peace on Your slave, Muhammad
Grant your ceaseless mercy, Lord
To Your blessed Prophet

O Allah, send Your peace on the people of his house
As You sent Your peace upon Nabi Ibrahim and his house
O Allah, send Your peace upon the people of his house
And all those who follow him
Till the coming of the Hour

O Allah! Raise him up to that praised lofty place
Grant him that approach to Thee and to Thy Grace

O Allah! Raise him up to that praised lofty place
On the Day his enemies, they will be disgraced
He was the King of trees keeper of the leaves
A deep green God of young love stained memory
We used to meet by him far from the hustling town
I loved you now they've come to cut you down, down

He was the guardian of days we held the same
Beneath the shade he gave shelter from the rain
Oh Lord how it's empty now with nothing save the breeze, I love you
Now they've come to burn the leaves, don't burn the leaves

And if my mind breaks up in all so many ways
I know the meaning of the words, I love you
And if my body falls inside an early grave

The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back
So slowly as I roll down the track
The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back
The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back, back
Please take me back

He was the King of trees keeper of the glades
The way he lightened my life makes me so amazed
We used to meet by him many years ago, I loved you
Now they've come to lay the road, don't lay the road
While lookin' into my drawer only yesterday
You know, the things that I saw made me cry
I saw the pictures and letters, I should have known better
Than to try to deny

I love them all, I love them all
And if they came again
I'd do the same again
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy

I'm that kind of a guy

And as I walked through the park where we used to play
You know, the bench and the tree are still there
And the pictures that you did, why am I so stupid?
They won't ever disappear

I love them all, I love them all
And if they came again
I'd do the same again
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy

'Cause I'm that kind of a guy

I love them all, I love them all
And if they came again
I'd do the same again
'Cause I'm that kind of a guy
Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the 18th Avenue

And it stung my tongue to repeat the words
That I used to use only yesterday
Meanings just dropped to the ground
I tried to remember what I thought
And what I used to say
Don't let me go down, no don't let me go

Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside
The empty waste of another day
Memories were blank to my eyes
The fire and the glory of that night
Seemed safely locked away
Too hungry to rise, too hungry to

Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the 18th Avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the 18th Avenue

But my head felt better as I turned the car
And the airport slowly came to view
"One mile" Said the sign
I checked my bags and made it straight to end gate 22
Made it just in time, boy you've made it just in time
They brang us up with horns and hollywooden songs
Dead snakes and poisoned wisdoms between our teeth
The evil that's been done still is carrying on
And on this night there'll be no peace

The old leaders' bones still beat on our homes
They built our life before us, we had no choice
The evil that's been done still is carrying on
And when they're gone we'll be the voice

Blue bird on a rock, slow wind blowing soft
Across the bare face of the sleeping lake
Rise up and be free, voice whispered to me
And in this way you will awake

Go climb up on a hill, stand perfectly still
And silently soak up the day
Don't rush and don't you roam, don't feel so alone
And in this way you will awake

And in this way you will awake
And this way you will awake

Pick up the pieces you see before you
Don't let your weaknesses destroy you
You know wherever you go the world will follow
So let your reasons be true to you
Stay close to your friends up until the end
And when they know that you feel the same way
Rise up and be free and die happily
And in this way you will awake

And in this way you will awake
And this way you will awake

Come the morning, I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere

Old world goodbye
'Cause I'll be home in the sky in the morning, bye bye
Stars are crying over my old house
But I'm still breathing happy above the clouds

Oh home, home at last
Because all of the bad times are past, past

Music is a lady that I still love
'Cause she gives me the air that I breathe
Music is a lady that I still need
'Cause she brings me the food that I eat

Come the morning, I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere

Home, world goodbye
'Cause I'll be home in the sky in the morning
Bye-bye, bye-bye
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grievin'

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never wanna see you a sad girl
Don't be a bad girl

But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

Baby, I love you
But if you wanna leave, take good care
I hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl
I remember standing here
Right on this very same site
I was dying but for you
It was just another night

You once rocked me in your world
You bought me my first shoes
I was just another lonely child
Oh, and you were much amused

So you took me and you dressed me well
All for your friends to see
You drained my body calmly till
There was no more left in me

Then you walked out and you cut me cold
Out on the road somewhere
Why it happened, well, I don't know
And I still have no idea

But everybody needs a friend sometimes
You need a little help
And who knows maybe one day you'll seek mine
Only time will tell

You once held me in your arms
You made me feel so right
I was flying but for you
It was just another night
But everybody needs a little help
Whether or not you think you really do
Everybody needs a little help
Now the time has come for you

I ain't looking to fight no wars
No more talking trash
I'm not seeking any more pain
'Cause I've had enough of that

But don't you worry it's alright
If you should come around
Any night or any day
I won't ever let you down
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away The other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt a light, entered my heart
When I awoke, I was mistaken
Ah, but the curtains were still blown apart You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away My mama once told me
What a soul should know
It's about the devil, and I hate him so
He'll be crying, if we don't frown
And keep on smiling
He'll stop hanging around You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
It's so quiet in the ruins
Walking though the old town
Stones crumbling under my feet
I see smoke for miles around

Oh, it's enough to make you weep
All that remains of the main street
Up in the park on Sunday
Dogs chasing and the children played

Old man with his head down
Can't see nothing more around, no
But he remembers how it used to be
Back in the old days

So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face
Come peeping through

Having tea In the afternoon, now
So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again

Ah, but it's all changed
Winter turned on a man
Came down on day
When no one was looking
And it stole away the land
People running scared, losing hands
Dodging shadows of falling sand
Buildings standing like empty shells
And nobody, helping no one else

Young child with his hands high
Ain't able to see no reason why, no
But he remembers how it used to be

So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face
Come peeping through

You'd better know
What you're going through now
You came back here to find
Your home is a black horizon
That you don't recognize

Evil destruction has taken everything
You'd better walk on the side
While you're still walking
Just keep on walking on
Down the street keep your distance
From the people you meet, oh, Lord
And you'd better watch your eyes
'Cause if smoke gets in them
Baby, you won't rise again
So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again

Where's it leading to
Freedom at what cost
People needing more and more
And it's all getting lost

I want back, I want back
Back to the time
When the earth was green
And there was no high walls
And the sea was clean
Don't stop that sun to shine
It's not yours or mine, no
In the blackness of the night I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt
I'm alone and there is no one by my side

In the blackness of the night I see a shadow passing by
From the heels of an old soldier boy
There's no compromising and his eyes are black as the sky
For this bad, bad world he is going to die
He's alone and there is no one by his side

In the blackness of the night I see a sparkle of a star
From the sweet silver tear of a child
And she's clutching at a photograph of long, long ago
When her parents were happy she was too young to know
She's alone and there is no one by her side

I'm alone and there is no one by my side

In the blackness of the night I seem to wander endlessly
With a hope burning out deep inside
I'm a fugitive, community has driven me out
For this bad, bad world I'm beginning to doubt
I'm alone, and there is no one by my side
I was seventeen, you were working for Matthew and Son
The Beatles met the Queen and I wrote
I'm gonna get me a gun, yeah yeah
It was like a dream in the star machine and oh no, is it so, is it so?

I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted to travel far
I only wanted a little bit of love
So I could put a little love in my heart

I never wanted to be la de da, go to parties 'avec le bourgeois'
I only wanted to sing my song well
So I could ring a small bell in your heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was on the road, sleeping between lorry lights, oh no
Stone drunk and cold, headin' into a bad night, yeah yeah
Just another bean in the star machine
Hi ho, here I go, here I go

I never wanted to be a star, buy my mum a Ferrari car
I only want to run my own race
So I could win a small place in your heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nature found a way, it picked me up off the dark side, yeah yeah
Showed me another day, it made me sing, I think I see the light
Not another bean in the star machine
Oh no, this time I won't go
I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted to travel far
I only wanted a little bit of love
So I could put a little love in my heart
I have journeyed endless nights
Seen many harbors where I took rest a while
On this boat court near and far
To be what you must you must give up what you are

Only on a wind of hope my heart sailed
Craving mystic oceans to arrive
Those who do not leave and choose to stay
Barley survive

Be a dust or be a star
To be what you must just reach out for what you are
And though you travel many worlds
There's but one way and that's the one you chose
Yesterday I was on the edge
Hopin' everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Tryin' to find another way to survive

New music, new music, new music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, can save us, oh, oh, oh

My friend said well, I think I found a way
To help make myself richer
I said don't you know , well, it won't be too long before
The bad old devil will get you back
Back I said put back your heart and sing, sing
While you know you're still living
Sing, sing, sing , while you know there's still

New music, new music, new music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, can save us, oh, oh, oh

Take a look at the world, think about how it will end
There'd be no wars in the world, if everybody joined the band
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
Thered be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show, oh, oh

Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
There'd be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show, in the show

New music, sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, oh, oh, oh

Yesterday I was on the edge
Hopin' everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Tryin' to find another way to survive
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're right or you're wrong
We're gonna know what you've done
We're going to see where you belong - in the end

You can't bargain with the truth
Whether you are black or you're white
We're going to know who's right
We're going to see you in the light - in the end

O and every little thing you do
You'd better know it's coming back to you

You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause one day you're gonna die
And good's going high
And evil's going down - in the end

You can't bargain with the truth
Whether you're old or young
We're going to see what you've done
There'll be nowhere else to run - in the end

You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're rich or you're poor
You're going to meet at the same door;
You're going to know the real score - in the end
And if you want to help your fellow man
You better start with what is in your hand

You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're right or you're wrong
We're going to know what you've done
We're going to see where you belong - in the end

You can't bargain with the truth;
'Cause if the world you chose
No further than your nose
Will be where the doors will close- in the end
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause for those who were deceived
There'll be no reprieve
There'll be no time to believe - in the end

O and every little thing you do
You better know it's coming back to you

You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause one day you're gonna die
And good's going high
And evil's going down - in the end
I used to trust nobody, trusting even less their words
Until I found somebody, there was no one I preferred
My heart was made of stone, my eyes saw only misty gray
Until you came into my life girl, I saw everyone that way
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life
I think I see the light coming to me
Coming through me, giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
I used to walk alone, every step seemed the same
This world was not my home, so there was nothing much to gain
Look up and see the clouds, look down and see the cold floor
Until you came into my life girl, I saw nothing, nothing more
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life
I think I see the light coming to me
Coming through me, giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
I think I see the light coming to me
Coming through me, giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Every time I dream I keep seeing streets and alleyways
Places that I've never known
Every time I dream I am being lifted to a height that
I'm too frightened to go
Then I wake up and find everything's the way it seemed one night ago

Every time I sleep I keep hoping
This would be the night of nights that I see you again
As I close my eyes like crimson curtains slowly rising on an empty stage
Then I'm back in the stall sitting all alone waiting for the show to begin

Every time I dream I would often find myself running
From a wild pack of lies
Till I reach your house and I hear the judge upstairs
And look for a place to hide
But if I saw you there I wouldn't dare dream again of opening my eyes
Once she came into my room, feathered hat an' all
Wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders
Two eyes like lights, milky marble whites looking up at me
Looking for a way, moon's in an endless day

All I knew was with her then, no couldn't see the time
As we drank down the wine to the last sweet Scarlet
How was I to wonder why or even question this
Underneath her kiss, I was so unguarded

Every bottle's empty now and all those dreams are gone
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

She was so much younger then, wild like the wind
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country
But deep beneath her curls
Beneath this misty pearl, there was more to see

She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife
She cut loose a life that she never, no never really wanted

All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone
Ah, but the song carries on, so holy

Come let us drink again, before the second show
I want you so to know, that there's no bridge between us
All those gates have opened now
And through the light has shone

Ah, but the song carries on, so holy
I can't budge baby, I can't move
Without your love to guide me
I don't know honey that's the truth
What laid you down beside me, yeah, yeah

Heat me with your love, oh
Your lips were meant for mine
Nobody else can bake me like a

No no no, like a bonfire
Your love is like a bonfire
Burning deep within me
Now some folks said
"It's no good to smoke in bed
But I just turn off my ears and
I jump into the fire again"

I feel so weak, yeah, I can't sleep
Without you there to hold me
Promise me you won't ever leave
Or I would die so coldly, yeah, yeah

Kiss me with your eyes, oh
Please don't let it rain
Don't kick no dust

On my bonfire
Your love is like a bonfire
Burning deep within me
Now it just grows, no matter
Where the wind blows
Yeah, but since you
Touched me I can't hide it
I've been so delighted with you

Yeah, yeah

Oh, heat me with your love
You opened up my heart
I just can't live without you
Oh, I just couldn't live another day

Your my bonfire
Your love is like a bonfire
Burning deep within me
Now some folks said
"It's no good to smoke in bed
But I just take off my clothes
And I jump into the fire again

Heat me baby, heat me
There is a wind, my Billy, and it's awful strong
Come for you and anyone who's helped you along
But I want to live, live, live and let the stars shine bright
Yes, I want to live, live, live and let it on alright

And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go

There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
And a northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
And a northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange

And with this gun goes everything I want to say
Not for you but for anyone who takes it away
Let it fill his life, life, life until there's nothing left
Let it kill his wife, wife, wife until he goes to bed

And when that bird sings from over that silver wall
I don't want to fight it, Billy, 'cause I want to go

There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
And a northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
And a northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange

There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
And a northern wind really makin' me feel kinda strange
There's a northern wind, Billy, blowin' up a southern change
Home on a kite we fly
Home on a breeze we blow
Eyeing the folks below and
Watching everybody run
Each one heading for a different place
Watching everybody hide
Each behind a different face

Home where the days are long
Back where the people are free
Home where all sides agree and
Everybody has a friend, oh
And no one ever has to grab
Everybody shares the love
Giving everything they have

Forever forever your lamp will burn
Forever home forever would that you'd learn
That you came with nothing
So with nothing you'll return

Home

You know you're not alone
It's only 'cause you're not a home
That you feel so out of place
Forever forever your lamp will burn
Forever home forever would that you'd learn

That you came with nothing
So with nothing you'll return

Home where all the mums can sing
Back where the children don't cry
Home where you never ask why and
Everybody has enough, and y'don't have to put on clothes
Nobody has to hide 'case everyone already knows
Yes, I'm gonna be a pop star

Oh mama, mama see me
Mama mama see me I'm home
Time rise

Time leaves you nothing
Nothing at all

Words, just words don’t know
Words take you nowhere
Nowhere to go, to go

Back....
I’m going back
Ooo, going back
I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel
And though my body's back I know it can't be real
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel
The house of freezing steel

Oh where's it going, picked me up at seven
When my eyes were weak from the light of the morning
Oh sister won't you tell me what a man might want to know
This madness is fine, yes if you're mad at the time

Back on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel
The tied my body up, I'm forced to eat my meal
A cold plate of lamb and cold potatoes too
Now what's a soul to do

Oh Lord above, brother won't you tell me
Is this a Eucharistic dove
'Cause I've been waiting for the right one to appear
But I've seen it in your face, and baby this ain't the place

Up on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel
I made my mind up then to get me to the wheel
I made the cabin door, the pilot turned around
He said we're Venus bound

Oh please take me home
After all I'm only human and the earth is where I belong
I must have looked pitiful to this freak without a face
'Cause as he touched my head I saw myself back in bed

I've flown the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel
And though my body's back I know it can't be real
'Cause I've been on that house without a guiding wheel
The house of freezing steel
I've been on the house of freezing, the house of freezing steel
I've been demoralized too many times
But now I realize, ah ah, no more

I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
'Cause I'm gonna get me a gun

I know my destiny is like the sun
You see the best of me when I have got my gun

I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
'Cause I'm gonna get me a gun

So you think you can push me around
And make me run, well, I'm gonna tell you now

I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
And all those people who put me down
You better get ready to run
'Cause I'm gonna get me a gun
Gonna get me a gun
Gonna get me, get me, get me a gun
Gonna get
I'm gonna get me a gun
I'm gonna get me a gun
Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
Everybody's sniffing it Banapple gas
Oh oh oh, yeah, alas
All the world is stuck on it Banapple gas

Does it do you good, make you better
Set you healthy when you're bed-tied?
Well, I don't know if it makes you well
But it must be healthy 'cause it don't smell

Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
Everybody's living on Banapple gas
Oh oh oh, yeah, alas
All the world is grooving on Banapple gas

Do you know what goes inside to make it
What kind of strange spice makes it right?
Well, I don't know what kind of spice
But it must be healthy 'cause it's sterilized

Banapple gas, Banapple gas
Give me more Banapple gas
Oh oh oh oh

Does it help you smile more to wake up
Make you happy just to be alive?
Well, I don't know if it makes you happy
But it must be healthy 'cause it's certified
Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
All the world is breathing Banapple gas
Oh oh oh, yeah, alas
No one knows what's inside it
Banapple gas, oh Banapple gas
Come on let's go down
Everybody's waiting for us down at the ghost town
Bill Bailey said he'd be around
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put that bad Havana down

Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn
Learning new tricks
From the Great Houdini
And that's the way she's gonna make it

Come on, come on let's go down
Everybody's waiting for us down at the boom town
O. Redding an' Washington
Chico an' Harpo an' Karl are in the kitchen with mum

Buster Keaton and King Tut
Are waiting for Disney to wake up
Now that's the way
No that ain't the way he's gonna make it
Oh, don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
Oh oh, this fool who, who left half his heart on an early train
(Aaa aaa aaa ooh)
Won't buy no more

Oh no
Don't use those same weepin' eyes
I've wipe them no more
Oh oh, I didn't want to have to be cruel
But the truth must be said
You ain't heard enough

Oh, it was not so long ago
Since you wandered out of here
To become a silver model of a city on the air
So don't choke me with your lies
Because this man has open eyes, I can see
I can see
I can tell
Oh oh oh oh
Umm umm

I had it enough
All those sneaky bars and smart parties
Had enough
All those sweet friends and lovers
I've had enough
All those lonely rooms and blank faces
I've had enough
And I want you, I want you no more
I want you, I want you no more
I, I don't want

Oh no, don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
Oh oh, this fool who, who left half his heart on an early train
Won't buy no more
What kind of power?
What kind of demon is this?
Who kicks me out in shame
With every word he says

What kind of majik of majiks?

What kind of war is this?
That I can't fight no more
That leaves me weaponless
And nails me to the floor

What kind of power, of powers?

What kind of man
Can make me turn and see?
The way I really am
Oh tell me who, oh who?

Where have my brothers gone?
Why I don't see them about?
They're all around him now
And keeping me out

What kind of madness, of, of madness?
"Go on and let him in, he's only asking for
A simple job to do and nothing more", they said
But looking back I see this stranger had the key
To any door he wished, with his eyes I say

What kind of majiks, of majiks?

What kind of man
Can make me turn and see?
The way I really am
Oh tell me who, oh who?

"Go on and let him in, he's only asking for
A simple job to do and nothing more", they said
"Go on and let him in", yeah, yeah

"Go on and let him in, he's only asking for
A simple job to do and nothing more"
But looking back I see this stranger had the key
To any door

In the daytime, time for celebration
No use looking down if it's over here
It's a world, a new creation

And the golden light of the morning
Makes it easy to comb your hair
And the love of a child, it's the time of the year

In the daytime, you can move a mountain
With a blink of your eye
Now it's over here, now it's over there

It's a world with no complications
And the curtains on the window start blowing like your hair
And the love that I feel 'cause it's the time of the year

Mysterious moon found me crying in the dark
Heard my footsteps on the stairs
No, no, mysterious moon found me crying
But the sun dried my tears, showed he cares

In the daytime, time for celebration
No use looking down, children open your eyes
It's a world, a whole nation

Now the white boats have landed
And the innocent are here
So dream for the child 'cause it's the time of the year
If you don't love me
Please don't treat me this way
'Cause I can't stand it
I see our love slipping away

Did you think that you could just put me down
Like a worn out shoe?
'Cause if you don't want me
Maybe, I don't want you

If you don't need me
Don't leave me out in the cold
Eyes drifting by me
Like somebody you don't know

Did you think that you could just walk away
Anytime you wanted to?
'Cause if you don't love me
Maybe, I don't love you

Did you think that you could just put me down
For somebody new?
'Cause nobody can love you, girl
Like I do

Every little bird in the sky
Would sing this song of love
If you would just take me back

Come on, open up your heart again
Woah, let me in, baby, baby

If you don't love me
Stop fooling yourself
No more acting
I know your show too well

Did you think that you could just shake my hand
With a, How d'y'do?
'Cause if you don't want me
Maybe, I don't want you

Oh, and as you go through life
It's the little things that come back again
Oh, if you came back again
You know I'd give my loving to you
You were always were so nice
When it came to problems you knew
I never did think twice
About ever coming to you

So granny, what on earth can I do?
Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?
'Cause this little girl, this little girl
She's a driving me wild, she's a driving me wild
So wild, so wild, so wild

You always straightened me out
When I was feeling rough
But this one I really doubt
'Cause this one's really tough

Oh granny, what on earth can I do?
Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?
'Cause this little girl, this little girl
She's a driving me wild, she's a driving me wild
So wild, so wild, so wild

So granny, what on earth can I do?
Granny, granny, what on earth can I do?
'Cause this little girl, this little girl
She's a driving me wild, she's a driving me wild
So wild, so wild, so wild
Maybe now
My love can get on its feet
You're my baby now
And that's something no one else can beat

Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure

Breakin' up
Must've done us some good
'Cause makin' up
Made me love you much more than I could

Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure

Kiss me now
Just like you used to do
And this is how
I tell if you love me too

Well, we're back to the good old times
And we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Baby, we're back to the good old times
And that's for sure
Well, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
Baby, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong

Yes, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
Baby, we're lovin' like we've never loved before
Keep, keep on lovin' and we'll never go wrong
How great the wonders of the heavens
And the timeless beauty of the night
How great - then how great the Creator?
And its stars like priceless jewels
Far beyond the reach of kings
Bow down for the shepherd guiding him home

But how many eyes are closed
To the wonder of this night?
Like pearls, hidden, deep beneath a dark
Stream of desires
But like dreams vanish with the call to prayer
And the dawn extinguishes night - here too are signs
God is the Light - God is the Light

How great the beauty of the Earth and the creatures
Who dwell on her
How great - then how great the Creator?
As it's mountains pierce the clouds
High about the lives of men
Weeping rivers for thousands of years

But how many hearts are closed
To the wonders of this sight?
Like birds on a cage, asleep with closed wings
But as work stops with the call to prayer
And the birds recite - here too are signs
God is the Light - God is the Light

How great the works of man and the things he makes
How great - then how great the Creator?
Though he strives to reach the heavens
He can barely survive
The wars of the world he lives in

Yet, how many times he's tried
Himself to immortalise?
Like his parents before him in the Garden of Eden
But like the sun sets with the call to prayer
And surrenders to the night here too are signs
God is the Light Everlasting
God is the Light Everlasting
God is the Light Everlasting
God is the Light Everlasting
I buy the nicest things from a super market store
Vitamin land and marzipan and I know just what they're all for

I've organized my useless life in a way I've never done before
Even visit the dentist now

But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter
I'm on my way
'Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter
I'm hoping to stay
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old, oh

I just can't wait to see that city on the moon
With air conditioned gardens that'll play your favorite tune

I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'd do
Even sweep the roads to be there

But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter
I'm on my way
'Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter
I'm hoping to stay
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old, oh oh oh

I'll see my feet upon that street if it's the last thing that I'd do
Even sweep the roads to be there

But I've got no time for silly chitter chatter
I'm on my way
'Cause while my blood's still warm and my mind doesn't matter
I'm hoping to stay
Because I've got a thing about seeing my grandson grow old, oh oh
Once I had a dream that worried me
Like a drunken guillotine
Lingering just above my head

Why, why, why, why?
Why was I born and I'm cursed repeatedly?
Who would know if I should die? No one needed me

Dark and empty was the place to which I'd come
Cold and silent was the house my name was on
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one
So dark and empty was the place to which I'd come

All at once my bones began to change
I was tall and young again
Sweet as rain falling on the snow

Who, who, who, who?
Who is he? Who am I and what laid in between?
How can I say goodbye? No one let me in

Can't see no need for nine no more
Now it's too late to open the door
You've got to learn to brighten up your ways
Kick out your dull padded life
There's much to know, and no doors in space
They were only mirrors, you imagined in your mind

Now that you've got no place to go
And you stand alone
Know that there's just one place to be
And it's in your soul, oh

Like drywood takes to fire, the truth will come to you
Like streams that seek the ocean, they will find ways through
Like morning meets the moon, my love will guide the way
It's time to wipe your eyes now and awake

I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you, oh

Be like the light in the shadows
Throw down your mask and be real
Don't wish to win and don't mind to lose
That was just a cycle like a squirrel in a wheel

Now that you've got no place to look
And you stand alone
Know that's there's just one place to be
And it is your home
Like fish that seek the water, the truth will come to you
Like leaves upon the soil, they will find ways through
Like flowers seek the sun, my love will guide the way
It's time to wipe your eyes now and awake, oh

You say you're really with me but you only follow me around
How much you love me, yes
But I don't want the kind of love
I have to sit down and count

You think you're free and lucky but you're stuck behind a prison wall
How well you know yourself
But I see something else within you
That you don't see at all

You may give up your number, disowning all your wealth
You may sell all the pieces, but you'll
Never never never give up yourself
Never never never give up yourself

Like drywood takes to fire, the truth will come to you
Like streams that seek the ocean, they will find ways through
Like morning meets the night's stars, my love will guide the way
It's time to wipe your eyes now and awake

I've come to take you over, there's much for you to do
I've come to take you over, then it's up to you
I work in the mornin', I work in the night
The men on the block they just laugh at me
I work in the mornin', I work in the night
The men on the block they just laugh at me

But when they're wiping their silver spoons
Palming the men for some bread
I'll be laughing
Way, way out of my head

When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party, a party no doubt
When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party

And if my mind isn't coming so fast
The men on the block say I'm on the brink
And if my mind isn't coming so fast
And I ain't so dumb as some people think

'Cause when they're wiping their silver spoons
Palming the men for some bread
I'll be laughing
Way, way out of my head

When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party, a party no doubt
When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party
I'll be laughing
Way, way out of my head

When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party, a party no doubt
When my little kitty gets out
There's gonna be a party
Miles from nowhere
I guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

Look up at the mountain
I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there

Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end

Miles from nowhere
Guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there

I creep through the valleys
And I grope through the woods
'cause I know when I find it my honey
It's gonna make me feel good

I love everything
So don't it make you feel sad
'cause I'll drink to you, my baby
I'll think to that, I'll think to that

Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it's alright
I have my freedom
I can make my own rules
Oh yeah, the ones that I choose

Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end

Miles from nowhere
I Guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view

Oh the path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And it stung my tongue to repeat the words
That I used to use only yesterday

Meanings just dropped to the ground
I tried to remember what I thought
And what I used to say
"Don't let me go down" no don't let me go

Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside
The empty waste of another day
Memories were blank to my eyes

The fire and the glory of that night
Seemed safely locked away
Too hungry to rise
Too hungry to

Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view

Oh the path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
But my head felt better as I turned the car
And the airport slowly came to view

One mile said the sign
Checked my bags and made it straight to End Gate 22
Made it just in time
Boy you've made it just in time
How many times must I get up
Look out and see the same old view, view?
How many times must I wear the same old things?
And hear the same old things that I do, I do

How many times must I clean this face, my face?
And how many times must I shine my shoes, oh Lord, Lord?
How many times must I drink the same old drink
And dream the same old dreams that I do?

Because I, I know one thing
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain
But for your line and mine
I want that loving again, again

How many times must I pass your place, your place?
And how many times must I follow you, you?
How many times must I see the same old things
When all I should be seeing is you?

Because I, I know one thing
There ain't nothing that could ever ease the pain
But for your line and mine
I want that love again, again, again

Must I follow you?
Must I wear the same old things?
There's too many objections
And not enough corrections
It's too much of the old way
Besetting on the new day
There's too many schemers
And not enough dreamers
Too many bad news
And not enough of good news
That's what the joke is
That's what the joke's made of
That's what the joke is
And that's what the joke's made of
'cos that's what the joke's made of
It's too many confusions
Not enough solutions
The world is disappearing
But nobody is caring
That's what the joke is
That's what the joke's made of
That's what the joke is
And that's what the joke's made of
'cos that's what the joke's made of
You say not to worry
Just sit back and wait
You say: What's the hurry?
I say: It's too late
Too late - it's too late
That's what the joke is
That's what the joke's made of
That's what the joke is
And that's what the joke's made of
'cos that's what the joke's made of
Oh Randy, if they knew
I think they'd take me sway
Just for loving you, you
All alone in my own quiet way
'Cause that's the way that I want it

Wish I could see you now
You and your cherry black eyes
My heart would never lie down, down
'Cause that's the way my arrow flies
And that's the way that I want it

You never said it would rain
You only told me that the sun would come again
You never said it would rain

Oh Randy, if you did
It wouldn't mean a thing
It wouldn't hurt me a bit
'Cause only you can break my wings
And that's the way that I want it

You drew my face in the sand
And ever since that day you made me what I am
You drew my face in the sand
Oh Randy, if I could
There's nothing I wouldn't give
To live with you for good
'Cause that's the way I'd like to live
And that's the way that I want it

Randy, oh my Randy
Oh Randy, oh my, my Randy
Oh Randy, oh my, my Randy
I was a child
Who ran full of laughter
I was a child who lived for today
My eyes full of sunshine
My heart full of smiles
I was a child for a day
We were the children
Who sang in the morning
We were the children
Who laughed at the sun
Who listened to those who spoke with their wisdom
We are the ones we would say, but

We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
We were the children of yesterday

We are the men who worry of nothing
We are the men who fight without aim
We listen to no one, yet speak of our wisdom
We are the pawns in the game

We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
We were the children of yesterday

I was a child
Who ran full of laughter
I was a child who lived for today
My eyes full of sunshine
My heart full of smiles
I was a child for a day

We're getting older as time goes by
A little older with everyday
We were the children of yesterday
Well, first I have to tell you that I'm not insane
And that once I was a famous archaeologist named
Who ran a recent expedition in a distant land
I just happened to passion' my hand in the sand

And then I stopped, looked and then I was hooked
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone
Then the mist started, started to clear
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone
Then it started to disappear

Well, I walked and walked and never talked for many days
And without a friend the desert is a lonely place
I was just about to turn around and make way home
When something told me that I had to see it again

And then I stopped, looked and then I was hooked
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone
Then the mist started, started to clear
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone
Then it started to disappear

Avuray
Avuray
Avuray
I saw a flash, then a sparkle from a moonstone
Then the mist started, started to clear
I saw a face, a face in the moonstone
Then it started to disappear
And then it started to disappear
And then it started to disappear
I know there'll be another time
There's going to be another moment
There'll never be another you
There's going to be another story, oh oh
There's so much left for you to do, love
There'll never be another you

There's going to be another spring
And it won't always be winter
And it'll always be spring
There's going to be another kingdom, oh oh
There's so much left for you to know, love

There'll never be another you
I will be there when you need me
Darling, you'll just have to say
But you know I'll be there anyway
You've got to have faith in me darling
Got to have faith in yourself, faith in your wealth

I know there'll be another spring
And it won't always be winter
And it'll always be spring
There's going to be another story, oh oh
There's so much left for you to know, love

There'll never be another you
There'll never be another you
There'll never be another you, love
How can I tell you that I love you... I love you
But I can't think of right words to say
And I long to tell you that I'm always thinking of you
I'm always thinking of you
But my words just blow away
Just blow away

Always ends up to one thing honey
And I can't think of right words to say

Wherever I am, girl, I'm always walking with you
I'm always walking with you
But I look and you're not there
Whoever I'm with, I'm always, always talking to you
I'm always talking to you
And I'm sad that you can't hear
Sad that you can't hear

It always ends up to one thing honey
When I look and you're not there

I need to know you
Need to feel my arms around you
Feel my arms surround you
Like the sea around the shore
Each night and day I pray
And hope that I might find you
And hope that I might find you
Because hearts can do no more

It always ends up to one thing honey
Still I kneel upon your floor

How can I tell you that I love you... I love you
But I can't think of what's right to say
I long to tell you that I'm always thinking of you
I'm always thinking of you

It always ends up to one thing honey
And I can't think of right words to say
I'd like to live in a wigwam
Yes, I'd like to live in a wigwam
I'd like to live in a wigwam
And dance round the totem pole

I'd like to live in an igloo
Yes, I'd like to live in an igloo
I'd like to live in an igloo
And fish from an ice hole

Oh, I'd like to ride on a caravan
I'd like to take a ride on a caravan
Yes, I'd like to ride on a caravan
And sing with the gypsies

I'd like to live on a commune
Yes, I'd like to live on a commune
I'd like to live on a commune
And people can call me a hippie

I don't want to live in a palace
No, I don't want to live in no palace
Oh, I don't want to live in no palace
There's too many empty rooms

I don't want to live in the barracks
Don't want to live in the barracks
Oh, I don't want to live in the barracks
And wake up to the bugle tune

I'd just like to live in a tree hut
Yes, I'd like to live on the tree hut
Yes, I'd like to live on a tree hut
And listen to the sound of the birds

And I don't want to live in a jail house
Don't wanna bide my time in no jail house
No, I don't want to live in no jail house
And be fed bread through the bars

I'm glad I'm alive, am I
I'm glad I'm alive, am I
I'm glad I'm alive, I'm glad I'm alive
I'm glad I'm alive, am I

We gotta get our heads up in the sky
We gotta get our heads up in the sky
We gotta get our heads up, gotta give it time
We gotta get our heads up in the sky

We gotta get to Heaven, get a guide
We gotta get to Heaven, get a guide
We gotta get to Heaven, we gotta have a guide
We gotta get to Heaven, get a guide
Baby, you're cool
And even though you've never been to school
I know you're fine
But then you change your mind
Then you start on driftin'
And fall on behind

You've been my girl
You've been mine
All of the time

A bad night
Its gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
Tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall

Ah, 'cause you left me waiting in the corner
And I know you're never gonna come back for me
And though you said you loved me
And said you needed all of my love
A bad, bad, bad, bad, bad night
Its gonna be
A bad night
It's gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
Tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall

Maybe if the weather was just a little better
It might not have happened that way
But the situation was gettin' pretty bad, bad
A bad bad bad bad bad night it's gonna be

A bad night
It's gonna be
A bad night
I guarantee
Tonight I'll have
A bad night
I know I shall
I know I shall
Hey Mr Gold Man where's my pay?
Hmm. Mr Gold Man not one more day
Mister, can't you hear my children cry?
Came to Pretoria in '46, find myself a job
Met a man with a broken arm, he said:
"Come along with us, get onto the bus"
Hey Mr Gold Man, I am for sale!
Hey Mr Gold Man. Please don't turn away
Hey Mr Gold Man, Can't you hear my tummy rumbling?
("Hey! You a gold digger? There's a job for gold diggers here
You won't get much – but it's a way to survive.")
So we continued down the road, till we got to the mine
Dirt and dust all around us now – Hey! I didn't mind
Cause I'm on the workline, oh oh
Hey Mr Gold Man, where's my pay?
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't wait another day
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't you see I'm almost dying?
("I'm a gold digger man
22 pence a shift – no overtime.")
Then I heard a good friend say: "There's a happening in Town
Come and join the Union, boy. ‘Cause today, we ain't going down
We're gonna stand our ground."
Hey Mr Gold Man, where's my pay?
Oh Mr Gold Man, won't wait another day
Oh Mr Gold Man, can't you hear the thunder coming?
Hey Mr Gold Man, loose these chains
Time Mr Gold Man, change is on its way
Go Mr Gold Man, don't come back, this is my country now
("You'd better be leaving now – Mr Gold Man.")
Oh the trees grow higher than the mountains
In the land of free love and goodbye
The river's ever flowing, fishing growing
And the God I love loves me

In the sky rides a gleam of white horses
And the glimmer clean in your eye
The bird of dawn is bringing
The simpleness of singing
And the God I love loves me

Oh the trees grow higher than the mountains
In the land of free love and goodbye
The river's ever flowing, fishing growing
And the God I love loves me

And the sun lies all around
And everything is as it must be
And winter lies underground
And the God I love loves me
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy

Soon I'm gonna slip away
In the night, I feel it creeping, creeping, creeping

I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy

I can't keep my mind away from my dreams
I hear them calling, calling, calling

Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
Soon I'm gonna slip away
In the night, I'm gonna slip away
I won't fight it, I'll just ride it

I'm so sleepy, yeah
I'm so sleepy, yeah
I could lay my head on a piece of lead
And imagine it was a springy bed
'Cause I'm sleepy, sleepy, yeah
You cut me deep
But now I'm gonna see you weep, yeah
This broken man
Is gonna do the best he can, yeah

I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart
Baby, I'll do without, there'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart and then turn away

You played with me like a toy and a little baby
After I broke you just didn't want to know, yeah

I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart
Baby I'll do without, there'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart and then turn away

My time will come
And you'll know when it's begun, yeah
You'll know because
You're gonna be just where I was, yeah

I'll see you pay, before I give you my heart
Baby, I'll do without, there'll come a day
When I'll smash your heart and then turn away
Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me
Though she don't want me

She follows badly in disguise
But it's not hard to recognize her
'Cause she's cryin'
She looks like dyin' on me

Her father's rich, I think a millionaire
But money doesn't make him better
It just makes him better to be there
So, you can tell him that its quite alright
No no, it's quite alright with me

Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me
Though she don't want me

She follows badly in disguise
But it's not hard to recognize her
'Cause she's cryin'
She looks like dyin' on me
See that shadow dancin' on the floor
She's coming up behind me
How I'd love to tell her she's a bore
But what I tell her that it's quite alright
No no, it's quite alright with me

Well here comes my wife
And that's the story of my life
She haunts me
Though she don't want me

She follows badly in disguise
But it's not hard to recognize her
'Cause she's cryin'
She looks like dyin' on me
Father, oh Father, hear me if You can
Is it true what they say that life is a dream? I don't understand
The things that make rain in my eyes
Are they real or are they lies?

You know I hear so much about You now
I'd give anything to go on a little boat with You
Talk about the scheme of things
On a little boat with You

Father, oh Father, guide me if You can
Or give me the chance to follow You home
I am Your son but I wish I knew You
When You were young were You lonely as a boy?

You know I'd give so much to see You now
I'd go anywhere, pick a little stick and walk with You
Talk about the scheme of things
On a short walk with You

Father, oh Father, You give me just a little hope
I feel something out there reaching for me
Well, here I am, won't You take me with You out of this maze
And away from this place

Because it gets so cold and lonely here
I'll do anything to sit on a little rock with You
Talk about the scheme of things
On a small rock with You

Show me, show me, show me the way
Before they grind me down and bleach me grey
Send me power not to be afraid and when I close my eyes
Let me see You once in the light

Father, oh Father, heal me if You can
Is it true what they say that life is a dream?
I take you out all over town
But you always start sittin' down
You never move, baby whats wrong with me?
When we go dancin', you're just there like a tree

Baby come on and dance, you're holding me back
I've gotta get out this feeling, before I go mad
You gotta let me in, the music's getting me now
You gotta come on and dance, stop hangin' around

I don't care if you twist or jive, just as long as you're lookin' alive
You'll make me glad, baby you'll make me rise
I wanna see that twinkle in your eyes

Baby come on and dance, you're holding me back
I've gotta get out this feeling, before I go mad
You gotta let me in, the music's getting me now
You gotta come on and dance, stop hangin' around
I have dreamt of a place and time,where nobody gets annoyed
But I must admit I'm not there yet but Something's keeping me going

Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Open up o world and let me in
Then there'll be a new life to begin

I have dreamt of an open world
Borderless and wide
Where the people move from place to place
And nobody's taking sides

Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Open up a world and let me in
Then there'll be A new life to begin

I've been waiting for that moment
To arrive
All at once the palace of peace
Will fill My eyes - how nice!

Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Maybe there's a world that I'm still to find
Open up o world and let me in
Then there'll be A new life to begin

I've been waiting for that moment
To arrive
All at once the wrongs of the world
Will be put right - how nice!
I've been pushed around
Made to look a clown
But now, now I know
It is time for me to start to grow

I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride

I'll show everyone
That my time will come
If you wait for me
I will show the world what I can be

I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride

Love does funny things
And to me it brings
Strength to carry through
And to make my name a pride to use

I'm gonna be king
I'm gonna see things right
I'm gonna be king
And you will be my bride
One is the ever blazing star
Sword of the immortal world
And highest light
Yes, this is our star

Our star is ever rising
Born of the eternal lamp and holy fire

Mighty burning mountain
The everlasting love of one is
One is, one is, one is, one is, one is

One is the ever kindling star
King of the immortal spark in Heaven's eye

Yes, this is our star
Yes, this is our star
Our star, our star
I was cold and so alone, so I couldn't help but moan
When the life that I was shown started crumbling
Then this crazy world that I live in, started giving more to me

Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself
Oh, I've never known a lady...

I was searching all the world, looking for a girl
Then a lady made an Earl of this poor boy
Now this crazy world that I live in, started giving more to me

Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself
Oh, I've never known a lady...

Now this crazy world that I live in, started giving more to me

Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself
Oh, I've never known a lady...

I've never known a lady...
Roadsinger came to town, long cape and hat
People stood and stared then closed their doors as he passed
He strolled the empty street, kids banged on tin cans
Then the panting dogs began to bark as the roadsinger sang

Where do you go? Where do you go when hearts are closed?
When a friend becomes a stranger nobody wants to know
Where do you go? Where do you go when the world turns dark?
And the light of truth is blown out and the roads are blocked

He stopped by a stall between the barrels and sacks
A child's face peeped out and gave a smile and ran back
Behind a misty glass on a windowpane
A little finger drew a perfect heart and a name

Where do you go? Where do you go in a world filled with fright?
Only a song to warm you through the night
Where do you go? Where do you go after lies are told?
And the light of truth is blown out and the night is cold

Roadsinger rode on to another land
Though the people spoke a different tongue it understand
They showed him how to share and took him by the hand
Showed him the path to heaven through the desert sand

Where do you go? Where do you go to find happiness?
In a world filled with hatred, tears
Where do you go? Where do you go if no one cares?
And everybody's lost looking for theirs
Well, if you're feelin' low, take it slow
Baby, get your head screwed on
I know he's left, but don't be depressed
Baby, let your favorite daddy see you through

Oh, baby you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind

You know you're nice, you're sugar and spice
And I know what you're going through
But if you're hot hot, and even if you're not
Baby, let your favorite daddy see you through

Oh, baby you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind

You were so neat, ever so sweet
And overnight you've seemed to change
Since you kissed your psychiatrist
Baby, you've never been the same

Well, if you're feelin' low, take it slow
Baby, get your head screwed on
I know he's left, but don't be depressed
Baby, let your favorite daddy see you through
Oh, baby you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind
Baby, you'll be out of your mind
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
And you can be missing such a lot that could be yours

Why can't I stop forgetting myself?
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else
Why can't I love you?
Why bother flying high above you
I know where you are

The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours

And who's going to miss me?
There'll only be myself to blame
You know I'd love to hold you tight
And love you all the night
But I don't even know my name

La la la
La la la
La la la

Why can't I stop forgetting myself?
Why am I always trying to be like somebody else?
Why can't I love you?
Why bother flying high above you
I know where you are
The view from the top can be oh so very lonely
And you can be missin' such a lot that could be yours
Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my hands
Lose my plough, lose my land
Yes, if I ever lose my hands
Oh if....
I won't have to work no more

And if I ever lose my eyes
If my colors all run dry
Yes if I ever lose my eyes
Oh if....
I won't have to cry no more

Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my legs
I won't moan, and I won't beg
Yes if I ever lose my legs
Oh if....
I won't have to walk no more
And if I ever lose my mouth
All my teeth, north and south
Yes if I ever lose my mouth
Oh if....
I won't have to talk...

Did it take long to find me?
I asked the faithful light
Did it take long to find me?
And are you gonna stay the night?

Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
His wisdom flowed from Heaven's Book
Just like threaded pearls
Just like threaded pearls
He left his self to flee to God
And God sent him back to us

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
He was born to guide

He prayed all his nights alone
And stars and angels sighed
And in the day, he lead the way
With blazing words so bright

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
He was born to be kind

He taught the people to worship
Bowing to one God, bowing to one God
His mercy stretched from east to west
To every man, woman and child

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
Nature sublime

He opened up the doors of love
For every heart parched with thirst
He was a mercy to the words
And unto the human births

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
He was born to guide
I see a road and I want to go home
I want to go home, my baby will be waitin' there
With a yellow ribbon in her hair
And I know that she won't disappear
'Cause she loves me too much

I see a road and I want to go home
I want to go home, my baby will be gettin' old
And I want to make sure she's not cold
Yes, I want to make sure she's not cold
'Cause I love her too much

Where silk music plays
Out in the country, out of the way
We'll make love, yeah, under the blue sky above
And we'll be riding on top of the world

I see a road and I want to go home
I want to go home, my baby will be waitin' there
With a yellow ribbon in her hair
And I know that she won't disappear
'Cause she loves me too much

I see a road and I want to go home
I see a road and I want to go home
I see a road and I want to go home
I see a road and I want to go home
There's a yellow flower by your bed
Sadly droopin' its perfumed head
So you won't smell it, I know what you'll miss

An' there's a hummingbird, a hummingbird
A hummingbird, a hummingbird
Oh, there's a hummingbird singing

There is the hat you made, the clothes you wore
Lying down on the cold, dirty floor
The colors are fading, they'll never shine again

An' there's a hummingbird, a hummingbird
A hummingbird, a hummingbird
Ah, there's a hummingbird singing

Now the road, it's turnin' gray
There's a shadow where you once lay
They'll find it tomorrow, and think you went alone

But there's a hummingbird, a hummingbird
A hummingbird, a hummingbird
Ah, there's a hummingbird crying
Now, I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be;
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be;
Some day it's going to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be;
Something good has begun

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train

Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train

Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends too
Because it's gettin' nearer;
It soon will be with you

Now, come and join the livin'
It's not so far from you
And it's gettin' nearer;
Soon it will all be true

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train

Now, I've been cryin' lately
Thinkin' about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating?
Why can't we live in bliss?

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah

Well, I ain't got nothing but it don't worry me
I came to this life like a free-walking tree
No need to be tied, no need to be
They call me Jzero

Well, I ain't got nothing and to nothing I belong
You won't find me right, yet you won't find me wrong
If you think about me don't think too long
Just call me Jzero

Well, I don't house no past, never carried a key
A sun doesn't rise from under the sea
There is only one morning eternally

Well, he says he hasn't got nothing
But he seems to possess less
He waltzed through the door like a tap dance with death
What kind of fool is he? No need to guess
Just call me Jzero

Well, I don't eat a lot, I do work for nothing so
If there's a job I can fill the gap
I don't need a room, a bed or a pillow, oh
Once you've decided to trust me with time
You won't need to look back

Well, I ain't got nothing but it don't worry me
I came to this life like a free-walking tree
No need to be tied, no need to be
They call me Jzero
Cat's in the yard
Fancy free
Dog barges 'round, says
"You can't catch me!
No siree."
There was a time
When I was younger
I'd chase the tail
Of any danger
About to learn
About to learn
Cat jumps a fence
Lands in a pram
Baby screams, "Mama!"
Out runs the man
Cat gets the can
There was a time
When I was bolder
I'd chase the heels
Of any stranger
About to learn
About to learn
Cat's In a cage
Chained to a stone
Empty Bowl by his side
Just an old fish bone
Dreams of home
There was a time
A long way back
When I would fall
For any dog trap
About to learn
About to learn
About to learn
About to learn
I like to take a walk out in the midday
Checking life out in the park
I like to take a walk out in the midday
Ah, but I avoid the city after dark

Oh, I love to see the children playing in the rain
Splashing books and kicking mud
Oh, I love to see the kids playing in the rain
Ah, but I avoid the city after dark

I love to feel the ocean blowing in my face
Wave as the old boats depart
I love to feel the wind blowing in my face
But avoid the city after dark

Bad brakes whole car shakes
Looks like I'm heading for a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
I must be heading for a breakdown

I pulled up for a mouth of Coca-Cola
Down at Samuel's Cafe
Saw a little Spanish lady coming over
Said, "Lady are you going my way?"
She said, "O-lay with your"

"Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like you're heading for a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
We must be heading for a breakdown"

We hit the road at 90 miles an hour
Heading for 'Frisco Bay'
She said "Senor you got cop on your shoulder"
I said "Oh now we'd better not stay
Now we got to get away with our"

"Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like we're heading for a breakdown"

He was catching up nose right inside our mirror
When the motor blowed
We climbed out and she began to shiver
"Oh, no sir, please let us go"
He said "Don't you know you got
"Bad brakes carburettor shakes
Looks like you bought yourself a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
And you've got yourself a breakdown"

Bad brakes engine beginning to shake
Looks like we got ourselves a breakdown
Black smoke engine beginning to choke
We got ourselves a breakdown
I'm crazy 'bout you, baby, my, my, my
Your love just drives me crazy, heaven knows why
So let me love you while the moon's still high
Guarantee, you we'll have a good time
Making love under the stars

I feel the earth move when I'm in your arms
Got the River Nile in my veins
And when you're with me, darling
I could be the white rabbit falling into space
Look at him go

Im crazy 'bout you baby, my, my, my
Your love just drives me cuckoo, heaven knows why
So let me love you while the moon's still high
Let yourself go and have a good time
Making love under the stars

I see the lights dance when we're holding hands
It's like magic being with you
And when I'm dogged out
I still dream about all the simple things that you do
All the little things

Im crazy 'bout you baby, my, my, my
Your love just drives me crazy, heaven knows why
So let me love you while the moon's still high
Let yourself go and have a good time
Making love under the stars
He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
The only bed he knows is the floor
The tramp

Turned up collar and worn out shoes
He doesn't care 'cause he hasn't got nothing to lose

He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
The only bed he knows is the floor
The tramp

No companion to take him home
His only friends are the kind that just leave him alone
No one knows just how lonely his life has been
In a world that lives in a dream

He sleeps alone in the damp
And rests his head upon a door
The only bed he knows is the floor
The tramp
One day at a time
We can learn to leave the past behind
One day at a time
We can look the future in the eye
One day at a time
We can learn to live

The gates of the garden are open
Wide and trusting
70 thousand will enter
Of them without reckoning

One day at a time
We can learn to leave our fears behind
One day at a time
We can stare our hopes in the eye
One day at a time
We can learn to live

And if you meet the evening
Don't wait for the sun to rise

One day at a time
We can leave all treasures behind
One day at a time
We can watch the clocks unwind
One day at a time
A child is born into this world
Eyes blind
One day he will find his sign
And glimpse some other kind of life to live by
One day
One day at a time
We can put machines behind
One day at a time
We can learn how birds survive
One day at a time
We can learn to fly
My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill
My lady D'Arbanville, why does it grieve me so?
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low?
My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill, yes, you will be my fill
My lady D'Arbanville, you look so cold tonight
Your lips feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white
My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
My lady D'Arbanville, why do you sleep so still?
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my fill
I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die
I loved you my lady, though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die
Why don't you come over?
It's lonely at the wooden lodge
Why don't you come and see our baby?
You haven't seen her for so long

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me

There in the back woods
We had our little piece of land
But everything wasn't so groovy
Not when you had to dirty your hands

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me

It's lonely at the wooden lodge
So why don't you share my bed?

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Life you make it what it is
Love can change it with a kiss
Love can take you by the hand
Love can drop you where you stand

But still you want to have it all
You like to live it up
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough

Life you make it what it is
Love can change it with a kiss
She can turn your head around
He can lift you off the ground

But still you want to have it all
You like to live it up
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough
But still you want to have it all
I thought you had enough

Love you make it what it is
Life can change it with a kiss
Love, love, love, love
You left me wearing nothing but a shell
You left me wearing nothing but a shell

This feeling you've left me
Is the image of hell

I thought that you loved me
Ah, but then I never could tell

I thought that you loved me
But then I never could tell

This feeling you left me
Is the image of hell

If you loved me like you said that you did
Oh, then darling, you couldn't have done the things that you did

You walk by my door, but you don't ring my bell
You walk by my door, but you don't ring my bell

This feeling you've left me
Is the image of hell
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard

They tell me to leave you, leave you behind
They tell me to leave you, just get you out of my mind
They tell me to leave you, just leave you behind
Oh, forget all the good times that are making me blind

I know you run around and you'll never settle down
And I should quit while I'm still on top
But when you hold me, baby, in your lovin' arms
I could love you forever, baby, but

When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard

They tell me to leave you, leave you behind
They tell me to leave you, just get you out of my mind
They tell me to leave you, just leave you behind
Oh, forget all the good times that are making me blind
That are making me blind

New York, poor New York
New York, poor New York

Cars choking your child to death
But you don't wanna see
'Cause you only think about yourself
How blind can you be

New York, poor New York
Sniper on the rooftop, New York
New York, poor New York
Not fit for a dog in New York

Everybody bites on the Big Apple
Leave the hungry in tears
But no one gives a damn, no one really cares
How they feel, they're just paper people not real

You need a gun to walk into New York

Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge
Who can help you this time
Now you're down to your very last cent
Still you're askin' me who was your friend, I was your friend

New York poor New York
Who turned the lights out in New York
New York, poor New York
Just another blackout in New York

Girl dead on the twenty sixth floor
But no one knew her name
Found her body behind the door
Too young for the game

New York, poor New York
Devils in the subway, New York
New York, poor New York
New York, poor New York

Talkin', talkin', talkin', watch out
Harlem touching midtown New York
New York, poor New York
Talkin' 'bout New York, New York
Money's getting tighter, New York
They're burning the bridges to New York

I want to feel your body close
From your head down to your toes
Maybe help you fold your clothes
Later

I want to spread the news, don't want to soft soap you
We're meant to live and love together girl Oh babe
There's nothing I can do, oh darling
I love you
There's no way you can stay home, alone, babe
Later

I want to talk it out with you
Try to get my message through
That's not all I want to do
Later
Later
I'm going home to the town where I was born
Where little children laughed as they sang
A happy song in the little town of Ceylon

Ceylon City, Ceylon City
Ceylon City, Ceylon City

I've got a boat, I hope it's still afloat
With rusty sails and an old wooden oar
It goes along in the little town of Ceylon

Ceylon City, Ceylon City
Ceylon City, Ceylon City

My daddy will be waiting there
My sister will be combing down her silver hair

My mamma will be waiting there
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere

My daddy will be waiting there
My sister will be combing down her silver hair

My mamma will be waiting there
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere
Ceylon City, Ceylon City
Ceylon City, Ceylon City
Ceylon City

My daddy will be waiting
My sister will be combing
My mamma will be serving
My brother will be hiding

My daddy will be waiting
Better bring another bottle with you, baby
If you really want to party then lets make it swing
Right into the morning
Better bring another bottle with you, baby
Cuz I really want to make this little bell ring
Ding dong, ding

I feel cold and I want to get you by my side
I feel bold and I want to show you how this man can ride

Better bring another bottle with you, baby
If you really want to party then lets make it swing
Right into the morning

Other people come and go
They try to make it through
I have to smile and tell them no
'Cause I only care for you, I only care for you

Yes, you are my sweet, sweet Jamaica
Country mama, brown country girl
When you touch me I, I feel so tall

If you let me down boy, I'd be so small
Yes, you are my sweet Jamaica
Country mama, brown country girl

Everybody needs a friend
To brighten up their world
I know you'll never let me down
'Cause you're not that kind of girl, no no no

I want to see you round every turn
You're my world, far as I'm concerned
Got no time to run about
Just want to spend my life out with you, only you

Yes, you are my sweet, sweet Jamaica
Country mama, brown country girl
Oh, yes, you are, sweet Jamaica
Oh brown country girl, ooh

People polishing guns
They've got nothing better to do
Though they think they're having fun
They're just living to die, if they but knew
Now, now

All day long they sit at home
Waiting for the milk to come
Watch them turn into stone
Thinking 'bout the things they might have done
Now, now

You missed the point, you missed the point
You really missed the point

Everybody's got to know
Love's the reason we're here
No matter which way you go
Love's gonna meet you there

Killin' time, killin' time
Killin' time, killin' time

You missed the point, you really missed the point
Made me cry, I wonder why, why
You missed the point, you missed the point
You really missed the point
The night was long and lonely
Everything inside was warm and tranquil, hey
I took a walk along the dark
Deserted stones of some old chapel, ahh

Didn't know quite what to do
And what I knew was all behind me, hey
So with the stars above my head
I let the silence set inside me and guide me

If only mother could see me now
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
He'd be so proud of this little devil boy

I saw seas of mirror
Without a reason to remind me, hey
And all the people that I'd loved
Were searching high above to find me, so kindly

If only mother could see me now
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
He'd be so proud of this little devil boy

Ahh, if only mother could see me now
On the white horse silver cloud
If only daddy could see me ride
He'd be so proud of this little devil boy, devil boy
School is out now we're gonna have some fun
We're gonna make like we are the only ones

I'm gonna buy a piece of the sky and sell the passing clouds
I'm gonna be a mayor of some small town and tax the crowds
I'm gonna be a local surveyor and study the foreman girls
I'm gonna line up some of the finest girls that are in the world

We're coming out of school today and we're so happy to be alive
It's gonna be the best day, the best day of our lives

I'm gonna be a history maker, I'll call myself Richard the Third
I'm gonna buy an amplifier and shout out "Have you heard?"

We're coming out of school today and we're so happy to be alive
It's gonna be the best day, the best day of our lives

We're coming out of school today, baby
I was born in the West-End
In the summer of '48
Above a small Cafe
Some people liked to come there and call it night
But for me it was all day
Oh! Now the dogs keep a growling
Round my front door
And the Truth howled out from the editing floor
Years went by
Quarrymen came along
This boy became a star
Then he dropped – but got up again
With a Black Everly guitar
Then he searched along the road
A good song he was looking for
And the Truth sang out from the editing floor
Big brother took a trip
As bold as he could be
To the place, he heard
Where the good Prophets used to walk
High above this dark world
Then the Word came down
And the little brother saw
How the Truth was buried on the editing floor
One day the papers rang us up
T'check if I said this?
I said, "Oh boy!
I'd never say that!"
Then we got down to the truth of it
But they never printed that!
Just like Socrates, the man from Greece
Fell down on his knees
Said, Lord! Forgive them please
Forgive them please
And he spoke no more
And the cup spilled out on the editing floor
Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my hands
Lose my plough, lose my land
Yes, if I ever lose my hands
Oh if....
I won't have to work no more

And if I ever lose my eyes
If my colors all run dry
Yes if I ever lose my eyes
Oh if....
I won't have to cry no more

Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my legs
I won't moan, and I won't beg
Yes if I ever lose my legs
Oh if....
I won't have to walk no more
And if I ever lose my mouth
All my teeth, north and south
Yes if I ever lose my mouth
Oh if....
I won't have to talk...

Did it take long to find me?
I asked the faithful light
Did it take long to find me?
And are you gonna stay the night?

Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Oh I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, l've gotta let it out
I've got to show the world, world's got to see, see all the love
Love that's in me I said, "Why walk alone, why worry when it's
Warm over here, you've got so much to say, say what you mean"
Mean what you're thinking and think anything
Oh why, why must you waste your life away
You've got to live for today, then let it go
Oh, lover, I want to spend this time with you
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know
And I can't keep it in, I can't hide it and I can't lock it away
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood
Blood spins my head and my head falls in love, oh
No, I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, l've gotta let it out
I've gotta show the world, world's got to know
Know of the love, love that lies low, so
Why can't you say, if you know, then why can't you say
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light
Light needs to shine, I said shine light , shine light
Love, that's no way to live your life
You allow too much to go by and that won't do
No, lover, I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while l'm with you
'N I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, l've gotta let it out
I've got to show the world, world's got to see, see all the love
Love that's in me, "I said, why walk alone, why worry when it's
Warm over here, you've got so much to say, say what you mean
Mean what you're thinking and think anything, why not?"
Now why, why, why not?
See the funny little people running 'round in circles
Throwing bombs as they do
See the funny side of it
They're heading straight for you

See the funny little holes they're making
Looking like craters on the moon
See the funny side of it
We'll be living in them soon

But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
But it's getting pretty near the end
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend
So there's never anything to spend
You're broke, you dope you

See the funny little flying saucers we found
Painted up just for you
See the funny man inside
His color matches too

See the silly little camera he loves
Shooting pictures with all day
See the funny side of it
His friends are on their way
But it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
But it's getting pretty near the end
Cause with a super life you will borrow everything you lend
So there's never anything to spend
You're broke, you dope you

Baby it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
Yes it's a super life, a super dupa dupa life we live
The moment you walked inside my door
I knew that I need not look no more
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realized all I had not seen
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

Oh will you? Will you? Will you?
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes

And if you walk along and if you lose your way
Don't forget the one who gave you this today

Follow True Love, follow True Love
Follow True Love, follow True Love

Oh will you? Will you? Will you?
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes

And if a storm should come and if you face away
That may be the chance for you to be safe
And if you make it through the trouble and the pain
That may be the time for you to know his name

The moment you walked inside my door
I knew that I need not look no more
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realized all I had not seen
I've seen many other souls before - ah but
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you said "I will"
I knew that this love was real
And that my faith was seen - oh
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment I looked into your eyes
I knew that they told no lies
There would be no good byes - Ah
'cause Heaven must've programmed you

I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
I go where True Love goes
Sit you down, sit you down young gentlemen
There's something I want you to know
You keep on asking me, keep on asking me why
Oh why are we here? It started a long time ago
Me and your mom on the night, yeah, yeah, yeah, we met

I was on the road again, she was in C79
I'll never, never forget, I'll never forget that night
No, no, no, no

We met in a back road, behind the stage
She had the best figure by far
A thousand hours I've looked at her eyes
But I still don't know what color they are
Yeah, me and your mom on the night, good lord, we met

I was on the road again, she was in C79
She was a junkie then, I was having a good time
Back on the road again

Oh momma, I was on the road again, she was in C79
I'll never never forget, I'll never forget that time
Back on the road again, yes, I'm traveling that line
I was a pop star then, I'm still having a good time

She believed me

Why don't you come over?
It's lonely at the wooden lodge
Why don't you come and see our baby?
You haven't seen her for so long

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me

There in the back woods
We had our little piece of land
But everything wasn't so groovy
Not when you had to dirty your hands

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me

It's lonely at the wooden lodge
So why don't you share my bed

Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Come on baby, shift that log
Come on baby, wash that dog
Give me all the love you've got, to me
Lovely city, when do you laugh?
Stoney people, what do you have?

Well, you ride around on a bright shiny cloud
And you think that you've found true happiness
There's no method in your mind
And your tempers are kind
Is it too much to ask to give it a rest?

Lovely city, when do you laugh?
Stoney people, what do you have?

I'm a part of you, you don't wanna be
I'm an unexpected visitor who's dropped in for tea
But I'm not so low you don't even know that I'm here
You can't even see

Lovely city, when do you laugh?
Stoney people, what do you have?
Oh, the trees grow higher than the mountain
In the land of free love and goodbye
The rivers ever growin' the fish is flowin'
And the love lives in the sky

In the night flies a team of white horses
And they glimmer clean in your eye
The bird of dawn is bringin' the simpleness of singin'
And the song lives in the sky

The trees grow higher than the mountain
In the land of free love and goodbye
The rivers ever growin' the fish is flowin'
And the love lives in the sky
There are no words, I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

Dreams I had just last night
Made me scared, white with fright
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

Fortunes come and fortunes go
But things get better babe, that's one thing I know
And I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road

I have a friend that I have met
Who gives me love and a certain respect
Just a little respect, everybody needs just a little respect
That means you. . .you...

And in a little while our love will spread
To you
Ain't no matter who inside this world you know
There'll he someone who will love you just for who you are
Really are

Dreams I had just last night
Made me worried to face up to the light
But I'm over to that Sunnyside Road
Over to that Sunnyside Road
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

Oh darling, you see my face
But it's in my heart that's where it's taking place
And I couldn't stand to let it go to waste
Can you ...

Oh love, sweet blue love
No man can ever get enough
But maybe one day we'll all die in love
Will you . .. Oh love, sweet love, my... love

Oh babe, understand
Take my love that's all I have at hand
Please say you will ... Don't say you can't
Oh Will you Will you Will you

The moment you walked inside my door
I knew' that I need not look no more
I've seen many other girls before, ah but darling
Heaven must've programmed you

The moment you fell inside my dreams
I realised all I had not seen
I've seen many other girls before, ah hot darling
Heaven must've programmed you
You can live in the largest house
And eleven apartments too
Run your own private plane
And a boat in Malibu

But 'till you know' deep down what inside you really need
Well I love you baby, Ooh my dear
And I think about you sometimes
But when you're with me boy it chokes my mind

Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on over and find yourself
Come on now it's freedom calling
Come on in and remind yourself

Man must fight for freedom sure that's what most other people
Would say
Look for a body to lead them but there's too many to lead them
Away
Why wait until it's your time to die before you learn what you
Were born to do'?
Come on now it's freedom calling but there's only one freedom
For you
Love, love boy...
And I can't wait to be with you tomorrow night
Won't you give me your word that you won't laugh
Cos you've been a saving grace to me
And I'd hate to face a day without you around
My life would be without sound

Love, love, love, love must've made you on a Sunday
Cos you taste to me as good as God made honey taste babe
And the sky all glistens with gold
When you're talking to me
And the whirling wind turns to song
Why it sets my soul free

Love, love. love. love must've made you on a Sunday

There are no words. I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
If I make a mark in time
I can't say the mark is mine
I'm only the underline of the word

Yes, I'm like him, just like you
I can't tell you what to do
Like everybody else I'm searching through what I've heard

Ohoho, where do you go when you don't want no-one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead?

Oh, preacher won't you paint my dream?
Won't you show me where you've been?
Show me what I haven't seen to ease my mind

'Cause I will learn to understand if I have a helping hand
I wouldn't make another demand all my life

Ohoho, where do you go when you don't want no-one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead?

What's my sex, what's my name?
All in all it's all the same
Everybody plays a different game, that is all

Now man may live, man may die
Searching for the question why
But if he tries to rule the sky he must fall
Ohoho, where do you go when you don't want no-one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead?

Now every second on the nose (Ohoho)
The humdrum of the city grows
Reaching out beyond the throes of our time

We must try to shake it down (Ohoho)
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time

Yeah, we must try to shake it down
Do our best to break the ground
Try to turn the world around one more time

Ohoho, where do you go when you don't want no-one to know?
Who told tomorrow Tuesday's dead?
(Fats Domino)

Blue Monday how I hate Blue Monday
Got to work like a slave all day
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday
I'm so tired got no time to play
Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks
My gal calls, got to tell her that I'm out
'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day
And Friday I get my pay
Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'
All my tiredness has gone away
Got my money and my honey
And I'm out on the stand to play

Sunday mornin' I'm feelin' bad
But it's worth it for the time that I had
But I've got to get my rest
'Cause Monday is a mess
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're right or you're wrong
We're gonna know what you've done
We're going to see where you belong - in the end
You can't bargain with the truth
Whether you are black or you're white
We're going to know who's right
We're going to see you in the light - in the end
O and every little thing you do
You'd better know it's coming back to you
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause one day you're gonna die
And good's going high
And evil's going down - in the end
You can't bargain with the truth
Whether you're old or young
We're going to see what you've done
There'll be nowhere else to run - in the end
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're rich or you're poor
You're going to meet at the same door;
You're going to know the real score - in the end
And if you want to help your fellow man
You better start with what is in your hand
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause whether you're right or you're wrong
We're going to know what you've done
We're going to see where you belong - in the end
You can't bargain with the truth;
'Cause if the world you chose
No further than your nose
Will be where the doors will close- in the end
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause for those who were deceived
There'll be no reprieve
There'll be no time to believe - in the end
O and every little thing you do
You better know it's coming back to you
You can't bargain with the truth
'Cause one day you're gonna die
And good's going high
And evil's going down - in the end
Who'll be my love
You'll be my love
You'll be my sky above
Who'll be my light
You'll be my light
You'll be my day and night
You'll be mine tonight

Lovely city, when do you laugh?
Stony people, what do you have?

Well, you ride around on a bright shiny cloud
And you think that you've found true happiness

Lovely city, when do you laugh?
Stony people, what do you have?
Bring tea for the tillerman, steak for the sun
Wine for the women who made the rain come
Seagulls sing your hearts away
'Cause while the sinners sin, the children play
Oh Lord, how they play and play
For that happy day, for that happy day
There are no words, I can use
Because the meaning still leaves for you to choose
And I couldn't stand to let them be abused, by you

Dreams I had just last night

Don't you feel a change a coming
From another side of time
Breaking down the walls of silence
Lifting shadows from your mind
Placing back the missing mirrors
That before you couldn't find
Filling mysteries of emptiness
That yesterday left behind

And we all know it's better
Yesterday has past
Now let's all start the living
For the one that's going to last
Yes we all know it's better
Yesterday has past
Now let's all start the living
For the one that's going to last

Don't you feel the day is coming
That will stay and remain
When your children see the answers
That you saw the same
When the clouds have all gone
There will be no more rain
And the beauty of all things
Is uncovered again

Don't you feel the day is coming
And it won't be too soon
When the people of the world
Can all live in one room
When we shake off the ancient
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb
We will all be born again
Of the eternal womb
I want to be your honey man
I want to be, I want to be your honey man
To wash your clothes and hold your hand
I want to be, I want to be your honey man

You've got a lot
But all of your money and stuff
Just isn't enough to buy what I can give
When things get rough
And all of your friendliest friends
Are turning to dust

We will live
You know I'll give you the world
I'll sacrifice girl anything
I'll do it all on my own, believe me
One day the sun will come down from the sky
Winter will fly and I won't feel cold
Gardens will light up with bright dapple horses
Gingerbread horses, that never grow old

There's so much that I have to do, I hope it won't be hard
And I hope it will be snowing on the day they make me Tsar
I go just where I want to and I won't be lead around
I'd like to try today but then I'm much too small for the crown

Animals will travel from distances far
Lead by a star to beat in my door
All kinds of strangers will come with no dangers
White velvet angels will sleep on my floor

There's so much that I have to learn, I hope it won't be hard
And I hope it will be snowing on the day they make me Tsar
I go just where I want to and with both feet on the ground
I'd like to try today but then I'm much too small for the crown

I go just where I want to and with both feet on the ground
I'd like to try today but then I'm much too small for the crown
Ooh..
'Cause if I laugh
Just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the chance
That I didn't have
To know you
And live
In peace
In peace

Ooh..
Oh, yeah, 'cause if I laugh
Just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the plans
That I didn't use
To get you
At home
With me
Alone

Ooh..
Oh, yeah..
Mmm..

'Cause if I laugh
Ooh, just a little bit
Maybe I can recall the way
That I used to be
Before you
And sleep
At night
And dream
Oh, yeah, 'cause if I laugh
Baby, if I laugh
Just a little bit

Oh, yeah..
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door, oh
I don't want no God on my lawn
Just a flower I can help along
'Cause the soul of no body knows
How a flower grows, oh how a flower grows
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door
Mary dropped her pants by the sand
And let a parson come and take her hand
But the soul of no body knows
Where the parson goes, where does the parson go?
Longer boats are coming to win us
They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us
Longer boats are coming to win us
Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door
Oh, I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me, Bitterblue
No, Bitterblue

'Cause I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up, oh, Bitterblue
Ah, Bitterblue

'Cause I've been runnin' a long time
On this travellin' ground
Wishin' hard to be free
Of going round and round
Yeah, yeah I've been movin' a long time
But only up and down

I gave my last hope to you
Don't hand it back to me, Bitterblue
My Bitterblue

Oh, I've done all one man can do
Please help me lose this, Bitterblue
My Bitterblue

Cause I've been waitin' a long time
Aeons been and gone
Looking at the horizon
For my light to dawn
Yeah, yeah, yes I've been livin' a long time
Looking on and on
I've been runnin' a long time
Summers come and gone
Whoa, oh, drifting under the dream clouds
Past the broken sun
Oh, yes, yes I've been livin' a long time
To be back beyond

I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me, Bitterblue
Oh, my Bitterblue

I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up, oh, Bitterblue
My Bitterblue
Oh, oh my Bitterblue
Yeah, my Bitterblue
My Bitterblue
Oh, Bitterblue

I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me, Bitterblue
It was a cold day in London
Dark clouds rumbling
Grabbed the yellow pages under the bed
I noticed an ad, it said

'Indian summer', '10 days of wonder'
'Paradise is yours for 50'
I thought to myself that's it

Told the wife to pack the bag
Forget about the plans we had
We're going east instead
She looked at me and shakes her head

I said, "Oh now, baby
I know it sounds crazy
But this may be the only chance we get
We only get one life to live"

So we grabbed the kids
And some body lotion
And we went to the middle of the
Indian Ocean

Our guide was there to meet us
'Welcome' sign to greet us
Ten porters stood up like a wall
Carried our bags to the hall

The custom man smiled to me
Begs so politely
"Tell me, sir, have you any more?"
I looked at him and said, "That's all"

They drove us to the beach house
I said, "Is this all ours?"
They nodded and rolled out the bed
I turned to my wife and said

"Ooh now honey, I guess it's still sunny
Let's all go down for a dip
Before the sun sets"

Suddenly I gazed up
Upon the rising wave
I saw the sea drawn from the sand
I grabbed the wife and kids and ran

"Please God, save us
Please don't blame us
For this is the only life we have
We'll make it up if we were bad"

The wave was a-pounding as we
Scrambled up the mountain
No one even dared to turn their head
Just one slip and you're dead

As the waves were dying
A child was crying
Searching for her mum and dad
A thin dress was all she had

She held us tight
We looked far and wide
But nothing there
There was nothing left
We all broke down and wept

Then came the morning
A new year was born
The girl had been with us all night
My wife looked down at her and sighed

"Oh my darling, it's suddenly dawning
But just take a look at those eyes
She must be paradise"
I listen to the Wind
To the wind of my soul
Where I'll end up well, I think
Only God really Knows

I've sat upon the setting sun
But never never never
I never wanted water once
No never never never

I listen to my words
But they fall far below
I let my music take me
Where my heart wants to go

I've swam upon the devil's lake
But never never never
I'll never make the same mistake
No never never never
See the funny little people running 'round in circles
Throwing bombs as they do
See the funny side of it
They're heading straight for you

See the funny little holes they're making
Looking like craters on the moon
See the funny side of it
We'll be living in them soon

But it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live
Yes, it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live

But it's getting pretty near the end
'Cause with a super life
You will borrow everything you lend
So, there's never anything to spend
You're broke, you dope you

See the funny little flying saucers we found
Painted up just for you
See the funny man inside
His color matches too

See the silly little camera he loves
Shooting pictures with all day
See the funny side of it
His friends are on their way

But it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live
Yes, it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live

But it's getting pretty near the end
'Cause with a super life
You will borrow everything you lend
So, there's never anything to spend
You're broke, you dope, you

But it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live
Yes, it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live

Baby it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live
Yes, it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live

Baby it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live
Yes, it's a super life
A super dupa dupa life we live

Baby it's a super life
A super
A hard, hard, hard

I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will take me for myself
And if I find my hard headed
Woman I won't need nobody else
No, no, no

I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman
I know the rest of my life will be blessed
Yes, yes, yes

I know a lot of fancy dancers
People who can glide you on a floor
They move so smooth but have no answers, whoh
When you ask them, "What d'you come here for?" "I don't know" "Why?"

I know many fine feathered friends
But their friendliness depends on how you do
They know many sure fired ways
To find out the one who pays
And how you do

I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me feel so good
And if I find my hard headed woman
Wo, I know my life will be as it should
Yes yes yes

I'm looking for a hard headed woman
One who will make me do my best
And if I find my hard headed woman...
Well, I left my happy home
To see what I could find out
I left my folk and friends
With the aim to clear my mind out
Well, I hit the rowdy road
And many kinds I met there
Many stories told me
Of the way to get there
So on and on I go
The seconds tick the time out
There's so much left to know
And I'm on the road to find out
In the end I'll know
But on the way I wonder
Through descending snow
And through the frost and thunder
Well, I listen to the wind come howl
Telling me I have to hurry
I listen to the robin's song
Saying not to worry
So on and on I go
The seconds tick the time out
There's so much left to know
And I'm on the road to find out
Then I found myself alone
Hopin' someone would miss me
Thinking about my home
And the last woman to kiss me, kiss me
But sometimes you have to moan
When nothing seems to suit you
But nevertheless you know
You're locked towards the future
So on and on you go
The seconds tick the time out
There's so much left to know
And I'm on the road to find out
Then I found my head one day
When I wasn't even trying
And here I have to say
'Cause there is no use in lying, lying
Yes, the answer lies within
So why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil's sin
Pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes, the answer lies within
So why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil's sin
Pick up, pick up a good book now
Yes, the answer lies within
So why not take a look now?
Kick out the devil's sin
Pick up, pick up a good book now
School is out now we're gonna have some fun
We're gonna make like we are the only ones
I'm gonna buy a piece of the sky and sell passing clouds
I'm gonna be a mayor of some small town and tax the crowds
I'm gonna be a local surveyor and study the foreman guilds
I'm gonna line up some of the finest girls that are in the world
We're coming out of school today
And we're so happy to be alive
It's gonna be the best day
The best day of our lives
I'm gonna be a history maker, I'll call myself Richard the Third
I'm gonna buy an amplifier and shout out, "Have you heard?"
We're coming out of school today
And we're so happy to be alive
It's gonna be the best day
The best day of our lives
We're coming out of school today, baby
We're coming out of school today
We're coming out of school today
School is out of school today
Well, I think it's fine, building jumbo planes
Or taking a ride on a cosmic train
Switch on summer from a slot machine
Yes, get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well, you roll on roads over fresh green grass
For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas
And you make them long, and you make them tough
But they just go on and on, and it seems that you can't get off

Oh, I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?

Well, you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air
But will you keep on building higher
Till there's no more room up there?
Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?
Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?

I know we've come a long way
We're changing day to day
But tell me, where do the children play?
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
Tables of paper wood, windows of light
And everything emptying into white
A simple garden with acres of sky
A brown haired dogmouse if one dropped by
Yellow Delanie would sleep well at night
With everything emptying into white
A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside
A black spider dancing on top of his eye
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike
And everything emptying into white
I built my house from barley rice
Green pepper walls and water ice
And everything emptying into white
