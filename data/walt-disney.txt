[Intro: Jasmine & Aladdin ]
How are you doing that?
It's a magic carpet
I-it's lovely...
You don't...you don't wanna go for a ride, do you?
We could get out of the palace, see the world
Is it safe?
Sure, do you trust me?
What?
Do you trust me?
Yes...

[Verse 1: Aladdin]
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Now tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Refrain 1: Aladdin]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "no"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Refrain 2: Jasmine, (Aladdin)]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)

[Verse 2: Jasmine]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Refrain 3: Jasmine, (Aladdin)]
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath; it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Refrain 4: Aladdin with Jasmine, (Jasmine)]
A whole new world
(Every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Refrain 5: Aladdin, Jasmine]
A whole new world
(A whole new world)
That's where we'll be
(That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
(A wondrous place)
For you and me
[Intro: Choir]
Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti
Beatae Mariae semper Virgini
Beato Michaeli archangelo
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis

[Verse 1]
Beata Maria
You know I am a righteous man
Of my virtue I am justly proud

(Et tibi Pater)

Beata Maria
You know I'm so much purer than
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd

(Quia peccavi nimis)

Then tell me, Maria
Why I see her dancing there
Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul

(Cogitatione)

I feel her, I see her
The sun caught in her raven hair
Is blazing in me out of all control

(Verbo et opere)

[Chorus]
Like fire
Hellfire
This fire in my skin
This burning
Desire
Is turning me to sin

[Verse 2]
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
I'm not to blame
It is the gypsy girl
The witch who sent this flame
(Mea maxima culpa)
It's not my fault
(Mea culpa)
If in God's plan
(Mea culpa)
He made the devil so much
Stronger than a man
(Mea maxima culpa)

Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone

[Chorus]
Hellfire
Dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or
Your pyre
Be mine or you will burn

[Outro]
God have mercy on her
(Kyrie Eleison)
God have mercy on me
(Kyrie Eleison)
But she will be mine
Or she will burn!
[TIMON & (PUMBAA)]
I can see what's happening (What?)
And they don't have a clue (Who?)
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line - our trio's down to two. (Oh.)

(In a sarcastic mock-French accent)
Ze sweet caress of twilight
(Back to normal, but still sarcastic)
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

[SIMBA]
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me

[NALA]
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?

[Chorus]
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

[TIMON]
And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed

[PUMBAA]
His carefree days with us are history

[TIMON & PUMBAA]
In short: Our pal is doomed
[ARIEL, spoken]
Maybe he's right. Maybe there is something the matter with me
I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad...

(sung)
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you think
"Sure, she's got everything"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal, I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancin'
Walking around on those - what do you call 'em? Oh - feet!

Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a - what's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free - wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word? Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea, wish I could be part of that world
[TIMON]
Hakuna matata! What a wonderful phrase!

[PUMBAA]
Hakuna matata! Ain't no passing craze!

[TIMON]
It means no worries, for the rest of your days...

[TIMON &amp; PUMBAA]
It's our problem-free philosophy...

[TIMON]
Hakuna matata!

Why, when he was a young warthog...

[PUMBAA]
When I was a young warthog...

[TIMON]
Very nice

[PUMBAA]
Thanks
[TIMON]
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the savannah after every meal

[PUMBAA]
I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
And, oh, the shame!

[TIMON]
He was ashamed

[PUMBAA]
Thought of changin' my name!

[TIMON]
Oh, what's in a name?

[PUMBAA]
And I got downhearted

[TIMON]
How did ya feel?

[PUMBAA]
Everytime that I...
[TIMON]
Hey! Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!

[PUMBAA]
Oh. Sorry...

[TIMON &amp; PUMBAA]
Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase
Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze

[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON]
Yeah, sing it, kid!

[TIMON &amp; SIMBA]
It's our problem-free

[PUMBAA]
Philosophy

[TIMON &amp; PUMBAA &amp; SIMBA]
Hakuna Matata!

[TIMON &amp; PUMBAA &amp; SIMBA]
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna...
[SIMBA]
It means no worries for the rest of your days

[TIMON &amp; PUMBAA &amp; SIMBA]
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!
Hakuna matata!

(SIMBA scat sings to fade)
(Make way for Prince Ali!)
(Say hey! It's Prince Ali!)

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Oh! You're gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa
Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as 10 regular men, definitely!
(He faced the galloping hordes)
(A hundred bad guys with swords)
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali
(He's got 75 golden camels)
Don't they look lovely, June?
(Purple peacocks, he's got 53)
Fabulous Harry, I love the feathers!
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
(Has he got a zoo?)
(I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie)

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak, weak at the knee
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him!)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
(With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali!)
You think I'm an ignorant savage
And you've been so many places
I guess it must be so
But still I cannot see
If the savage one is me
How can there be so much that you don't know?
You don't know...

You think you own whatever land you land on
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the Earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind
[Hook 1]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That brings the bare necessities of life

[Verse 1]
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I couldn't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzin' in the tree
To make some honey just for me
When you look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

[Interlude 1]
(You eat ants!?)
Haha, you better believe it
You're going to love the way they tickle
(Mowgli, watch out!)

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Hook 2]
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

[Verse 2]
Now when you pick a pawpaw
Or a prickly pear
And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw

[Interlude 2]
Have I given you a clue?
(Golly, thanks Baloo!)
(Pawpaw, hah! Of all the silly gibberish)
C'mon Baggy, get with the beat!

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!

[Verse 3]
So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
Cause let me tell you something little britches
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh
You're working too hard

[Verse 4]
And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found
When you find out you can live without it
And go along not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true

[Bridge]
The bare necessities of life will come to you
They'll come to you!
[Verse 1]
I have often dreamed of a far-off place
Where a great, warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be

[Chorus]
I will find my way, I can go the distance
I'll be there someday, if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to feel like I belong

[Instrumental interlude]

[Chorus]
I am on my way, I can go the distance
I don't care how far, somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belong
[Intro]
Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they've got up there

[Verse 1]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

[Verse 2]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
(Guess who's gon' be on the plate)

[Chorus 2]
Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea
Under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea

[Verse 3]
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat, they know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

[Chorus 3]
Under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea
[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

[ZAZU]
Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair

[SIMBA]
I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar!

[ZAZU]
Thus far, a rather... uninspiring thing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

[ZAZU]
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

[SIMBA]
No one saying do this

[ZAZU]
Now when I said that, I -

[NALA]
No one saying be there
[ZAZU]
What I meant was...

[SIMBA]
No one saying stop that

[ZAZU]
Look, what you don't realize...

[SIMBA &amp; NALA]
No one saying see here

[ZAZU]
Now see here!

[SIMBA]
Free to run around all day

[ZAZU]
Well, that's definitely out

[SIMBA]
Free to do it all my way!

[ZAZU]
I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart to heart
[SIMBA]
Kings don't need advice from little hornbills for a start

[ZAZU]
If this is where the monarchy is headed, count me out!
Out of service, out of Africa - I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing

[SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm standing in the spotlight!

[ZAZU]
Not yet!

[ANIMALS]
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

[ANIMALS &amp; SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh I just can't wait... to be king!
[Verse 1: Megara]
If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

[Bridge 1: Muses]
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

[Chorus 1: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love

[Verse 2: Megara]
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
[Bridge 2: Muses]
(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

[Chorus 2: Megara + Muses]
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)
Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)
[SCAR, spoken]
I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

(sung)
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But–thick as you are–pay attention!
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares!

So prepare for the chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

[SHENZI]
And where do we feature?

[SCAR]
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Yeah, be prepared! Haha! We'll be prepared! For what?

[SCAR, spoken]
For the death of the king!

[BANZAI, spoken]
Why? Is he sick?

[SCAR, spoken]
No, fool, we're going to kill him. And Simba too!

[SHENZI, spoken]
Great idea! Who needs a king?

[SHENZI &amp; BANZAI &amp; ED, spoken]
No king, no king, la la la la la la!

[SCAR, spoken]
Idiots! There will be a king!
[BANZAI, spoken]
Hey, but you said, uh...

[SCAR, spoken]
I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

[HYENAS, spoken]
Yeah! Alright! Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

(sung)
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

[SCAR]
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

[SCAR &amp; HYENAS]
So prepare for the coup of the century (Oooh!)
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh... La! La! La!)
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!)
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food)
Decades of denial (We repeat)
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat)
Be king undisputed (Aaah...)
Respected, saluted (...aaah...)
And seen for the wonder I am (...aaah!)
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared (Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo)
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
[NARRATOR, spoken]
You go girls...

[CALLIOPE, spoken]
We are the muses
Goddesses of the arts
And proclaimers of heroes

[TERPSICHORE, spoken]
Heroes like Hercules

[THALIA, spoken]
Honey you mean Hunk-ules!
Woohoo, I'd like to make some sweet music-

[CALLIOPE, spoken]
Our story actually begins long before Hercules
Many eons ago

(sung)
Back when the world was new
The planet earth was down on its luck
And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok

[THALIA]
It was a nasty place!
There was a mess where ever you stepped
[CALLIOPE]
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept

[THALIA, spoken]
Woo! Sing it girlfriend

[ALL MUSES]
But then along came Zeus!

[CALLIOPE]
He hurled his thunderbolt

[ALL MUSES]
He zapped-

[CALLIOPE]
Locked those suckers in a vault

[ALL MUSES]
They're trapped-
And on his own stopped chaos in its track
And that's the gospel truth
The guy was too type A to just relax!

[TERPSICHORE]
And that's the world's first dish
[THALIA, spoken]
Yeah, baby

[MELPOMENE]
Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth

[ALL MUSES]
Though honey it may seem impossible
That's the gospel truth!
On Mt. Olympus life was neat
And smooth as sweet vermouth
Though honey it may seem impossible
That's the gospel truth
[Esmeralda]
I don't know if you can hear me
Or if you're even there
I don't know if you would listen to a gypsy's prayer

Yes, I know I'm just an outcast
I shouldn't speak to you
Still I see your face and wonder
Were you once an outcast too?

God help the outcasts
Hungry from birth
Show them the mercy
They don't find on Earth
God help my people
We look to you still
God help the outcasts
Or nobody will

[Townspeople]
I ask for wealth
I ask for fame
I ask for glory to shine on my name
I ask for love I can possess
I ask for God and his angels to bless me

[Esmeralda]
I ask for nothing
I can get by
But I know so many
Less lucky than I

Please help my people
The poor and down-trod
I thought we all were children of God

God help the outcasts
Children of God
[SHADOWS]

[Verse 1]
It's a world of laughter, a world of tears
It's a world of hopes and a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all

[Chorus]
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world

[Verse 2]
There is just one moon and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to everyone
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all

[Chorus]
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world
[MUSES]
Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro! Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S-R-O
He was a no one (A zero, zero)
Now he's a hot shot, he's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero just like that

When he smiled the girls went wild with
"Oohs" and "aahs"
And they slapped his face on every vase
(On every "vase")

From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian earn

Say "Amen!," there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains and spunk
From zero to hero a major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"? (Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre? (Hercules!)
Isn't he bold? (No one braver!)
Isn't he sweet? (Our favorite flavor!)
Hercules!, Hercules!
Hercules!, Hercules!
Hercules!, Hercules!

Bless my soul, Herc was on a roll - undefeated
Riding high (And the nicest guy) - not conceited
He was a nothing (A zero, zero)
Now he's a hot shot, he's a hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero (Awww, yeah!)
Yes indeed!
[DWARFS]
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
In a mine the whole day through
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
Is what we like to do

It ain't no trick
To get rich quick
If you dig dig dig
With a shovel or a pick
In a mine (In a mine)
In a mine (In a mine)

Where a million diamonds
Shine

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
From early morn to night
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig
Up everything in sight

We dig up diamonds
By the score
A thousand rubies
Sometimes more
We don't know what we dig them for
We dig dig dig a-dig dig

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We pillage plunder, we rifle and loot
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We extort and pilfer, we filch and sack
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
Maraud and embezzle and even highjack
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We kindle and char and in flame and ignite
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We burn up the city, we're really a fright
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

We're rascals and scoundrels, we're villains and knaves
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
We're devils and black sheep, we're really bad eggs
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me
We're beggars and blighters and ne'er do-well cads
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho
[Aladdin]
Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
That's everything!

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[Guards]
Riffraff!
Street rat!
Scoundrel!
Take that!

[Aladdin]
Just a little snack, guys

[Guards]
Rip him open
Take it back, guys

[Aladdin]
I can take a hint
Gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu!

[Harem Girls]
Who?
Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one-man rise in crime

[Harem Manager]
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em

[Aladdin]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[Guard, Merchant, Aladdin and Woman]
Stop, thief!
Vandal!
Abu!
Scandal!

[Aladdin]
Let's not be too hasty

[Woman]
Still I think he's rather tasty

[Aladdin]
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
(Wrong!)

[Aladdin (and the Guards)]
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street Rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Riffraff!)

Here goes
Better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landing
All I gotta do is jump!
[PEDDLER]
Oh, I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

Arabian nights, like Arabian days
More often than not are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Arabian nights 'neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
[Intro: Choir]
Olim
Olim deus accelere
Hoc saeculum splendidum
Accelere fiat venire olim

[Clopin]
Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame

To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city's
The toll of the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

(Speaking)
Listen, they're beautiful, no?
So many colours of sound, so many changing moods
Because you know, they don't ring all by themselves

[Puppet]
- They don't?

[Clopin]
No, silly boy
Up there, high, high in the dark bell tower
Lives the mysterious bell ringer
Who is this creature?

[Puppet]
- Who?

[Clopin]
What is he?

[Puppet]
- What?

[Clopin]
How did he come to be there?

[Puppet]
- How?

[Clopin]
Hush, and Clopin will tell you
It is a tale, a tale of a man and a monster

(Sung)
Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

[Man #1, spoken]
Shut it up, will you!

[Man #2]
We'll be spotted!

[Woman]
Hush, little one

[Clopin, sung]
Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

[Man #3, spoken]
Four guilders for safe passage into Paris

[Clopin, sung]
But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

[Man #1, spoken]
Judge Claude Frollo!

[Clopin, sung]
The bells of Notre Dame

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

[Frollo, spoken]
Bring these gypsy vermin to the palace of justice

[Guard]
You there, what are you hiding?

[Frollo]
Stolen goods, no doubt. Take them from her

[Clopin]
She ran

[Chorus, sung]
Dies irae, dies illa (Day of wrath, that day)
Solvet saeclum in favilla (Shall consume the world in ashes)
Teste David cum sibylla (As prophesied by David and the sibyl)
Quantus tremor est futurus (What trembling is to be)
Quando Judex est venturus (When the Judge is come)

[Woman, spoken]
Sanctuary, please give us sanctuary!

[Frollo]
A baby? A monster!

[Archdeacon]
Stop!

[Clopin, sung]
Cried the Archdeacon

[Frollo, spoken]
This is an unholy deamon
I am sending it back to Hell, where it belongs

[Archdeacon, sung]
See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

[Frollo, spoken]
I am guiltless. She ran, I pursued

[Archdeacon, sung]
Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

[Frollo, spoken]
My conscience is clear!

[Archdeacon, sung]
You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes

The very eyes of Notre Dame

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
And for one time in his life
Of power and control

[Chorus]
Kyrie Eleison (Lord have mercy)

[Clopin]
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

[Frollo, spoken]
What must I do?

[Archdeacon]
Care for the child, and raise it as your own

[Frollo]
What? I'm to be saddled with this misshapen...?
Very well. Let him live with you, in your church

[Archdeacon]
Live here? Where?

[Frollo]
Anywhere
(Sung)
Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

(Spoken)
The bell tower, perhaps
And who knows, our Lord works in mysterious ways

(Sung)
Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

[Clopin, spoken]
And Frollo gave the child a cruel name
A name that means "half-formed":
Quasimodo

(Sung)
Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man?

[Clopin and Chorus]
Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame
[Chorus]
So long, farewell, to you, my friends
Goodbye for now, until we meet again
I said so long, farewell, to you, my friends
Goodbye for now, until we meet again

[Bridge]
It's been great to play and sing together (In the box)
And now it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
So long, farewell, to you, my friends
Goodbye for now, until we meet again
Goodbye for now, until we meet again
[SCAT CAT]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat
Who knows where it's at

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Tell me
Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat
'Cause everything else is obsolete

[SCAT CAT, spoken]
Strictly high-button shoes!

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born

[SCAT CAT]
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
But with a square in the act
You can set music back

[SCAT CAT]
To the cave man days
Cha-cha-ba-dum-bo-day
[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing

[SCAT CAT]
Still a cat's the only cat who knows how to swing

[BILLY BOSS]
Who wants to dig a long-haired gig and stuff like that?

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
When everybody wants to be a cat

A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born
Ever'time he plays

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[SCAT CAT, THOMAS O'MALLEY]
With a square in the act, you can set music back
To the cave man days

[MARIE]
Oh, a-rinky-tinky-tinky

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Yes
[MARIE, THOMAS O'MALLEY &amp; SCAT CAT]
Everybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
While playin' jazz you always has a welcome mat
'Cause everybody digs a swingin' cat

[DUCHESS]
If you want to turn me on
Play your horn, don't spare the tone
And blow a little soul into the tune

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
Let's take it to another key

[SCAT CAT]
Modulate, and wait for me
I'll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon

[THOMAS O'MALLEY]
The other cats will all commence
Congregatin' on the fence
Beneath the alley's only light

[DUCHESS]
Where every note is out of sight
[ALLEY CATS]
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (I'm telling you!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Yeah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Mmm)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat! (Hallelujah!)
Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat...
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for, you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

(spoken)
Oh, that clock!  Old killjoy.  I hear you, come on, get up you say!  Time to start another day!  Even he orders me around.  Well, there's one thing - they can't order me to stop dreaming.  And perhaps, someday -

(sung)
The dreams that I wish will come true

(vocalizing with mice)

No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
[MOANA]
I count the steps from one end of my island to the other
It's a hundred steps from where I sleep to the sea
And when I say I've learned all there is to know
Well there's another little island lesson
Gramma Tala shows me

I know where I am from the scent of the breeze
The ascent of the climb
From the tangle of the trees
From the angle of the mountain
To the sand on our island shore
I've been here before

There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
Someday I'll be out on the sea
And I'm gonna see more
Yes, there's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always—

[VILLAGERS]
Moana, slow down

[MOANA]
Sorry! I'm always in somebody's way
They do the same thing every day
They work, they eat, they sleep, they pray
They tell me

[MOANA and VILLAGERS]
"Moana, calm down!"

[MOANA]
That's all they ever seem to say
The other kids just dance and play
How can you play?
There's so much out there to explore

[CHIEF TUI]
She stares at the sky, she stumbles down the beaches
She mumbles all the names that her Gramma Tala teaches
 
With one foot here and another in the distant past
 
[SINA]
She's growing up too fast
 
 
 
 
[MOANA]
And I wanna soar
 
So much to explore
[MOANA]
Like I said before
There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
One day I'll be brave and sail on the wave
That leads me to more

There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
My father the Chief, says "Don't cross the reef"
But, oh, every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back to the sea
I'm standing at the edge of the sea
As they all say

[MOANA and SINA]
"Moana, slow down
Moana, dream small
Moana, don't drown"

[MOANA]
Can you drown at the call of the sea?
'Cause I can hear it calling me

[ANCESTORS]
Aue, aue

[MOANA]
A thousand years ago, we used to sail to distant islands
A thousand years ago, Maui spoke to the sea
So maybe, just maybe, I was born to break the silence
I know my story could be extraordinary
I know my story doesn't end at the shore

There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
I'm gonna break through, and find something new
I'm gonna find more

There's gotta be more
I know there's more, there's always more
One day I'll decide to roll with the tide
And I'm gonna see

[VILLAGERS]
Moana stand tall

[MOANA]
I will cross the divide, I will ride
I will see what's on the other side

[VILLAGERS]
Moana, stand proud

[MOANA]
With the ocean as my guide, on the tide
I will go where no one's ever been before
There's always more
[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

When Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
Then there's something very wrong
Cause this may be the last time now
That you hear the boogie song, ohhh

[THREE BATS]
Ohhh
[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[SEVEN LIZARDS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[SEVEN LIZARDS]
Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Well if I'm feelin' antsy
And there's nothin' much to do
I might just cook a special batch
Of snake and spider stew
And don't ya know the one thing
That would make it work so nice?
A roly-poly Sandy Claws to add a little spice

[THREE SKELETONS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Oh, yeah
[THREE BATS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Ohhh

[THREE BATS]
Ohhh

[OOGIE BOOGIE, THREE SKELETONS]
Oh, yeah, I'm (he's) the Oogie Boogie Man

[SANTA]
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff
[SANTA, spoken]
What are you going to do?

[OOGIE BOOGIE, spoken]
I'm gonna do the best I can

(sung)
Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

[SANTA]
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere
[Verse 1]
Now, I'm the king of the swingers, uh
The jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, man-cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too

[Verse 2]
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub
And don't get in a stew
What I desire is man's red fire
So I can be like you
Now gimme the secret, man-cub
Just clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
And make my dreams come true

[Verse 3]
Now I will ape your mannerisms
And we'll be a set of twins
No one will know
Where man-cub ends and orangutan begins
And when I eat bananas
I won't peel them with my feet
'Cause I'll become a man
Man-cub and learn some etiquette

[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too

[Outro]
Can learn to be
Human too
I wanna be like you
I wanna feel human, too
[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Once there was a Princess -

[DOC, spoken]
Was the Princess you?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
And she fell in love -

[SNEEZY, spoken]
Was it hard to do?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Well, it was very easy. Anyone could see that the Prince was charming. The only one for me

[DOC, spoken]
Was he strong and handsome?

[SNEEZY, spoken]
Was he big and tall?

[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
There's nobody like him. Anywhere at all

[BASHFUL, spoken]
Did he say he loved ya?

[HAPPY, spoken]
Did he steal a kiss?

[SNOW WHITE]
He was so romantic
I could not resist

Someday my prince will come
Someday we'll meet again
And away to his castle we'll go
To be happy forever I know

Someday when spring is here
We'll find our love anew
And the birds will sing and wedding bells will ring
Someday when my dreams come true

[Opening Music]

[JACK]
What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air

What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack this isn't fair
What's this?

What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead
There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look

What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire

What's this? What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think?
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now correct me if I'm wrong

This looks like fun, this looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them
Only little cozy things, secure inside their dreamland
(Sigh)
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems
To be good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me has been filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it oh, I want it oh
I want it for my own
I've got to know, I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town? Hmm...
[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Wanna know a secret?
Promise not to tell?

(sung)
We are standing by a wishing well

Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true[SNOW WHITE]
I'm wishing
For the one I love[ECHO]
I'm wishingTo find me
TodayTo find me
TodayI'm hoping
And I'm dreaming ofI'm hopingThe nice things
He'll sayThe nice things
He'll say(vocalizing)[SNOW WHITE]
I'm wishing
For the one I love[ECHO]
I'm wishingTo find me
TodayTo find me[PRINCE]
Today

Now that I've found you
Hear what I have to say
One song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you

One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true

One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through

One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
[PINOCCHIO]
I've got no strings to hold me down
To make me fret, or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
There are no strings on me

Hi-ho the merry-o
That's the only way to be
I want the world to know
Nothing ever worries me

I've got no strings so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
They've got strings, but you can see
There are no strings on me

[DUTCH MARIONETTE]
You have no strings, your arms is free
To love me by the Zeider Zee
Ya, ya, ya, if you would woo
I'd bust my strings for you

[FRENCH MARIONETTE]
You got no strings, couci couca
Your savoir faire is oo-la-la
I've got strings, but entre nous
I'd cut my strings for you
[RUSSIAN MARIONETTE]
Down where the Volga flows
There's a Russian rendez-vous
Where me and Ivan goes
But I'd rather go with you, hey

[PINOCCHIO]
There are no strings on me
The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is Tiggers are wonderful things
Thier tops are made out of rubbers
Their bottoms are made out fo springs
They're bouncy, trouncy, founcy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is
I'm the only one
The wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is Tiggers are wonderful chaps
They're loaded with vim and with vigor
And love to leap in your laps
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about Tiggers
Is
I'm the only one
Tiggers are wonderful fellahs
Tiggers are awfully sweet
Everyone else is jealous
And that's why I repeat...
(Repeat first)
Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one when you play
Don't you mind what you say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

From your head to your toes
You're so sweet goodness knows
You are so precious to me
Cute as can be, baby of mine
[Verse 1]
What I love most about rivers is:
You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing
But people, I guess, can't live like that
We all must pay a price
To be safe, we lose our chance of ever knowing
What's around the riverbend
Waiting just around the riverbend

[Chorus]
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend
For me
Coming for me

[Verse 2]
I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming
For a handsome sturdy husband
Who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?
Just around the river bend
Just around the river bend

[Chorus]
I look once more
Just around the river bend
Beyond the shore
Somewhere past the sea
Don't know what for...
Why do all my dreams extend
Just around the river bend?
Just around the river bend...

[Verse 3]
Should I choose the smoothest course
Steady as the beating drum?
Should I marry Kocoum?
Is all my dreaming at an end?
Or do you still wait for me, Dream Giver
Just around the river bend?
[Verse 1]
[SIMBA]
As you go through life you'll see
There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go
The way we planned
But you'll see every day
That we'll never turn away
When it seems all your dreams come undone
We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one

[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one

[Verse 2]
[KIARA]
If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me the way I am?
Can I trust in my own heart?
Or am I just one part of some big plan?
[SIMBA]
Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun
Tears of pain, tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride, deep inside
We are one

[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one

[Verse 3]
[SIMBA]
We are one, you and I
We are like the earth and sky
One family under the sun
All the wisdom to lead
All the courage that you need
You will find when you see
We are one!
[Chorus]
[LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO]
Family
Family
We are one
Family
Family
We are one

(chorus is repeated and ad-libbed until the end)
[SALLY]
I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend
And does he notice
My feelings for him?

And will he see?
How much he means to me
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
All though I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic loud
Try as I may
It doesn't last

And will we ever
End up together?
No I think not
It's never to become
For I am not the one
[Verse 1]
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say?
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want me to be

[Verse 2]
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy—no, I'm a man
You can't take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown?
Yeah, you stand here on your own
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Verse 3]
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted, I could be
Now you know me, and I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me, as long as I know who I am

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They can't see me but I'm still here

[Bridge]
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah, the world is still sleepin'
While I keep on dreamin' for me
And their words are just whispers
And lies that I'll never believe

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can you say I'll never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now 'cause I'm still here

[Outro]
I'm the one, 'cause I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
[Verse]
"Riffraff," "Street rat"
I don't buy that
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a poor boy?
No, siree
They'd find out
There's so much more to me...

(spoken)
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change. We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all.​​
[DREAM ELEPHANTS]
Look out! Look out!
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come!
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

Look out! Look out!
They're walking around the bed, on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade

What'll I do? What'll I do?
What an unusual view!
I could stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms
Is really too much for me

I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright!
What a sight!

Chase 'em away!
Chase 'em away!
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade!

Pink elephants!
Pink elephants!
[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws...

[LOCK]
I wanna do it!

[BARREL]
Let's draw straws!

[SHOCK]
Jack said we should work together

[BARREL]
Three of a kind

[LOCK]
Birds of a feather

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights
[SHOCK]
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

[LOCK]
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

[SHOCK]
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Wheeee!
[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Oooooohooo! Yum,yum,yum,yum

[LOCK]
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

[SHOCK]
You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

[LOCK &amp; SHOCK]
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

[BARREL]
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet
[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Mmmmmm!

We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

[SHOCK]
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

[BARREL]
I'm not the dumb one

[LOCK]
You're no fun

[SHOCK]
Shut up!

[LOCK]
Make me

[SHOCK]
I've got something, listen up
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiousity...

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

[LOCK, SHOCK &amp; BARREL]
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key!!!
Ha,ha,ha,ha!

[OOGIE BOOGIE]
Sandy Claws, hm... ?
[Verse 1]
If there's one God you don't want to get steamed up
It's Hades, 'cause he had an evil plan
He ran the Underworld
But thought the dead were dull and uncouth

[Verse 2]
He was as mean as he was ruthless
And that's the Gospel truth
He had a plan to shake things up
And that's the Gospel truth
[AURORA]
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once the way you did once upon a dream

[VOCALIZING]

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once

[AURORA &amp; PHILLIP]
The way you did once—

[PHILLIP]
—Upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam

[CHOIR]
And I know it's true, that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once the way I did once upon a dream
[Verse 1]
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella

She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella de Vil

[Bridge]
At first you think Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize you've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock!

[Verse 2]
This vampire bat, this inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella de Vil
[CROWS]
I seen a peanut stand, heard a rubber band
I seen a needle that winked its eye
But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything
When I see an elephant fly

(What d'you say, boy?)
I said when I see an elephant fly

I seen a front porch swing, heard a diamond ring
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie
But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything
When I see an elephant fly

{Bridge}

I saw a clothes horse, he r'ar up and buck
And they tell me that a man made a vegetable truck
I didn't see that, I only heard
But just to be sociable, I'll take your word

I heard a fireside chat, I saw a baseball bat
And I just laughed till I thought I'd die
But I be done seen 'bout ev'rything
When I see an elephant fly
{Bridge}

Well I be done seen 'bout ev'rything
When I see an elephant fly
(With the wind)

When I see an elephant fly
(spoken)
It happened on one of those zip-a-dee-doo-dah days. Now that's the kind of day when you can't open your mouth without a song jumping right out of it!

(sung)
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
My oh my, what a wonderful day
Plenty of sunshine headin my way
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay

Mister Bluebird's on my shoulder

Everything is satisfactual

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
Wonderful feeling, wonderful day

Yes, Sir
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay)

Mister Bluebird's on my shoulder
It's the truth (mm hmm), its actual (mm hmm)
Everything is satisifactual

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay
Wonderful feeling, feeling this way

Huh? Where is that blue bird?

Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega
Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega
Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega
Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega

Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute
Seasons go and seasons come
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives
Plant the squash and reap the bean
All the earth our mother gives

O Great Spirit, hear our song
Help us keep the ancient ways
Keep the sacred fire strong
Walk in balance all our days

Seasons go and seasons come
Steady as the beating drum
Plum to seed to bud to plum
(Hega hega ya-hi-ye hega)
Steady as the beating drum
Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega
Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega
Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega
Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega

[Jafar, spoken]
Oh Princess! There's someone that I'm dying to introduce you to

[Aladdin, spoken]
Jafar, get your hands off her!

[Jafar]
Prince Ali, yes, it is he
But not as you know him!
Read my lips and come to grips
With reality

Yes, meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say "hello" to your precious Prince Ali!

[Iago, spoken]
Or should we say, "Aladdin"?

[Jasmine, spoken]
Ali?

[Aladdin, spoken]
Jasmine, I— I tried to tell you! I'm just—

[Jafar]
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin
Just a con, need I go on?
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
So long!

[Iago, spoken]
Goodbye, see ya!

[Jafar]
Ex-Prince Ali!
Hehahaha!
[Verse 1]
Deception
Disgrace
Evil as plain as the scar on his face
Deception
(An outrage!)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came

Deception
(An outrage!)
(He can't change his stripes)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
(You know these Outsider types)
Evil as plain as the scar on his face
(See you later, agitator!)
Deception
(An outrage!)
(Just leave us alone!)
Disgrace
(For shame!)
(Traitor, go back with your own!)
He asked for trouble the moment he came
(See you later, agitator!)
[Bridge]
Born in grief
Raised in hate
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run
Let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive!

[Verse 2]
And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us
Not our kind
Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he'll never be one of us

He is not one of us
Deception
Disgrace
Mmm-mmm-mmm, deception
Disgrace
Deception
Gonna shout it from the mountaintops
(A star is born)
It's a time for pullin' out the stops
(A star is born)

Honey, hit us with a Hallelu
The kid came shinin' through
Girl, sing the song
Come blow your horn
A star is born

He's a hero who can please the crowd
(A star is born)
Come on everybody, shout out loud
(A star is born)

Just remember in the darkest hour
Within your heart's the power
For making you a hero too

So don't lose hope when you're forlorn
Just keep your eyes upon the skies
Every night a star is, right in sight is
Burning bright, a star is born

Like a beacon in the cold dark night
A star is born
Told ya everything would turn out right
A star is born
Just when everything was all at sea
The boy made history
The bottom line, he sure can shine
His rising sign is Capricorn
He knew how to
He had a clue
Telling you a star is born

Here's a hero who can please a crowd
(A star is born)
Come on everybody, shout out loud
(A star is born)
Just remember in the darkest hour
Within your heart's the power
For making you a hero too

So don't lose hope when you're forlorn
Just keep your eyes upon the skies
Every night a star is, right in sight a star is
Burning bright, a star is born
[Chorus]
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flappin' fish and the girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true
I swear by my tattoo

[Verse 1]
There was Mermaid Minnie, met her down in Madagascar
She would kiss me, any time that I would ask her
Then one evening her flame of love blew out
Blow me down and pick me up!
She swapped me for a trout

[Chorus]
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flappin' fish and the girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true
I swear by my tattoo

[Verse 2]
There was Typhoon Tessie, met her on the coast of Java
When we kissed I bubbled up like molten lava
Then she gave me the scare of my young life
Blow me down and pick me up!
She was the captain's wife

[Chorus]
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flappin' fish and the girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true
I swear by my tattoo

[Bridge]
Then there was Harpoon Hannah
Had a look that spelled out danger
My heart quivered when she whispered "I'm there, Stranger"
Bought her Trinkets, that sailors can't afford (Sailors can't afford)
And when I spend my last red cent
She tossed me overboard!

[Chorus]
Got a whale of a tale to tell ya, lads
A whale of a tale or two
'Bout the flappin' fish and the girls I've loved
On nights like this with the moon above
A whale of a tale and it's all true
I swear by my tattoo
[FROLLO]
The world is cruel
The world is wicked
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city
I am your only friend

I who keep you, teach you, feed you, dress you
I who look upon you without fear
How can I protect you, boy, unless you
Always stay in here
Away in here

(spoken)
Remember what I taught you, Quasimodo

(sung)
You are deformed

[QUASIMODO]
I am deformed

[FROLLO]
And you are ugly

[QUASIMODO]
And I am ugly

[FROLLO]
And these are crimes
For which the world
Shows little pity
You do not comprehend

[QUASIMODO]
You are my one defender

[FROLLO]
Out there they'll revile you
As a monster

[QUASIMODO]
I am a monster

[FROLLO]
Out there they will hate
And scorn and jeer

[QUASIMODO]
Only a monster

[FROLLO]
Why invite their calumny
And consternation?
Stay in here
Be faithful to me

[QUASIMODO]
I'm faithful

[FROLLO]
Grateful to me

[QUASIMODO]
I'm grateful

[FROLLO]
Do as I say
Obey
And stay
In here

[QUASIMODO]
I'll stay
In here

[QUASIMODO]
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me

All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them

And out there
Living in the sun
Give me one day out there
All I ask is one
To hold forever

Out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day out there

Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Ev'ry day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I was in their skin
I'd treasure ev'ry instant

Out there
Strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there
Like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there

Just one day and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent
One day
Out there
[Anna:]
I came all this way, today
To give us a fresh start
But now that you're like "wow"
It's all like warm in my heart

[Elsa:]
I'm so glad you like it, sis
Cause this is the real me
You have no idea
How great it feels to be free

[Anna:]
We've been falling out for way too long
So let's forget who's right

[Elsa:]
And forget who's wrong

[Both:]
Okay!

[Elsa:]
Why don't you stay?
There's room for family in my court
[Both:]
Cause life's too short

[Anna:]
To always feel shut out and unloved
By the sister I long to know

[Both:]
Life's too short

[Elsa:]
To never let you celebrate me
The true queen of the ice and snow

[Anna:]
Wohohooo

[Both:]
I never (I never) understood
But now I do
Life's too short
To miss out on a sister like you

[Anna:]
So you'll come back, then
[Elsa:]
Back?

[Anna:]
To thaw the fjord, it's frozen over, no one can get in or out?

[Elsa:]
Oh

[Anna:]
Sooo...

[Elsa:]
Oh!!!!
I don't believe you!

[Anna:]
What?! I just assumed that you would have to...

[Elsa:]
That I'll shove on the gloves?
That's how your story ends?

[Anna:]
It does! It's just like it was
Except for we'll be best friends
[Elsa:]
So that's in your plan
To force me back in a cage

[Anna:]
Whoa, whoa! Don't get upset
Let's get back on the same page

[Elsa:]
Gee'z,Thanks for coming up to see the place
And showing off your mastery of tact and grace
Run down the hill and spill my secrets
Make a full report!
Bye-bye!

[Anna:]
Wait!

[Elsa:]
Cause life's too short

[Anna:]
There it is!
The door you love to slam in my face!
You did well there for a spell
But now you're back in the same place
Kick me out if you want, but I'm the only one who
Is not one hundred percent convinced the prophecy's you!

[Elsa:]
You can think whatever you want cause I don't care
You're a fool who married a stranger!

[Anna:]
That is so unfair

[Both:]
I swear
I'm through with taking your unshaking sisterly support!
Support!
Support!
Ha! Life's too short!

[Anna:]
To let you treat the people down there
Just as coldly as you always treated me

[Elsa:]
La la lalala laaaa

[Both:]
Life's too short!

[Elsa:]
To listen to a reckless fool
Who only ever sees the things she wants to see

[Anna:]
You don't know me

[Elsa:]
You have no idea

[Both:]
What I've been through
Because of you

Life's too short to waste another minute
Life's too short to even have you in it
Life's too short

[Anna:]
I've been so wrong about you

[Elsa:]
You?! You've been so wrong about everything

[Anna:]
Maybe you are the prophecy!

[Elsa:]
I am NOT the prophecy!
[KING LOUIE]
Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be humen too

[MOWGLI, spoken]
Gee, cousin Louie
You're doin' real good

[KING LOUIE, spoken]
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire

[MOWGLI, spoken]
But I don't know how to make fire

[KING LOUIE]
Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you

You!

Someone like me

Like someone like me
Can learn to be
Like someone like you
Can learn to be
Like someone like me!
Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or underland
Or just behind the tree

When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land beyond the eye
That people cannot see

Where can it be
Where do stars go
Where is the crescent moon
They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder where
[ROUSTABOUTS]
Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
We work all day, we work all night
We never learned to read or write
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
We don't know when we get our pay
And when we do, we throw our pay away
We get our pay when children say
With happy hearts, "It's circus day today"

Muscles achin'
Back near breaking
Eggs and bacon what we need (Yes, sir!)
Boss man houndin'
Keep on poundin'
For your bed and feed
There ain't no let up
Must get set up
Pull that canvas! Drive that stake!
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off
But must keep awake

Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep!

Swing that sledge! Sing that song!
Work and laugh the whole night long
You happy-hearted roustabouts!
Pullin', poundin', tryin', groundin'
Big top roundin' into shape
Keep on working!
Stop that shirking!
Grab that rope, you hairy ape!
Poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! poundin'!
Oh
[Verse 1]
Young Herc was mortal now
But since he did not drink the last drop
He still retained his godlike strength
So thank his lucky star

[Verse 2]
But Zeus and Hera wept
Because their son could never come home
They'd have to watch their precious baby
Grow up from afar

[Verse 3]
Though Hades' horrid plan
Was hatched before Herc cut his first tooth
The boy grew stronger every day
And that's the gospel truth

The gospel truth
[Verse: SNOW WHITE]
Just whistle while you work
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
So hum a merry tune
It won't take long when there's a song to help you set the pace

And as you sweep the room
Imagine that the broom
Is someone that you love
And soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune

When hearts are high the time will fly
So whistle while you work

So whistle while you work
I'm just a little black rain cloud
Hovering under the honey tree
I'm only a little black rain cloud
Pay no attention to little me
Everyone knows that a rain cloud
Never eats honey, no, not a nip
I'm just floating around over the ground
Wondering where I will drip
She showed me day after day
How to find my way
She taught me how to rely
On the wind and sky
She named me after the sea
She believed in me
I know we use to be bold
From the tales she told
I know she left me prepared
From the things she shared
There was more she wanted to see

Staring at the barrier together on the shore
We practice all the names of everyone who came before me
Voyagers, warriors, ancestors in our line
Their blood runs in mine

She always knew more
She hungered for more
She taught me more
And somehow I know
She'd want me to go

To navigate, you have to keep your island in your mind
You'll know what lies ahead if you remember what's behind you
Want to find the answers to the questions that you still don't know
You just have to go, find more
I wanna know more
There's always more
How can I stay
She taught me the way

Every turn I take
Every trail I track
Every path I make
Every road leads back to the sea
I am sailing to the edge of the sea
And it calls me—

Moana go now
Moana don't stall
Don't worry 'bout how
Just answer the call of the sea
There's nothing there holding me

If I had time
I'd say goodbye

I will cross the divide, I will ride
I will see what's on the other side
With the ocean as my guide, on the tide
I will go where no one's ever been before
There's always more
Put your faith in what you most believe in
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these lives we see

A paradise untouched by man
Within this world blessed with love
A simple
Life, they live in peace

Softly tread the sand below your feet now
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these
Lives we see

Beneath the shelter of the trees
Only love can enter here
A simple life, they live in peace

Raise your head up, lift high the load
Take strength from those that need you
Build high the walls, build strong the beams
A new life is waiting but danger's no stranger here

No words describe a mother's tears
No words can heal a broken heart
A dream is gone but where there's hope

Somewhere, something is calling for you
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these lives we see
I will beat the odds, I can go the distance
I will face the world, fearless, proud, and strong
I will please the gods, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome right where I belong
[JACK]
There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort of my ghost-like charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I Jack the PUMPKIN KING!
Have grown so tired of the same old thing...

Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
And since I am dead I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown- if they only understood
He would give it all up if he only could

Oh there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears...
[Verse 1: Kiara]
In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have the world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I know love will find a way
Anywhere I go, I'm home
If you are there beside me

[Chorus]
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

[Verse 2: Kovu]
I was so afraid, now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes
[Kovu and Kiara]
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

[Pre-Chorus: Kovu and Kiara]
They'd know love will find a way
Anywhere we go, we're home
If we are there together

[Chorus: Kovu and Kiara]
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way
I know love will find a way
If I never knew you
If I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of
How precious life can be
And if I never held you
I would never have a clue
How at last I'd find in you
The missing part of me
In this world so full of fear
Full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear
In your eyes, so dry your eyes
And I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you
If I never knew you
I'd be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel
A love so strong and true
I'm so grateful to you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Lost forever
If I never knew you
I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we made the whole world bright
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they'd leave us where these whispers in the night
But still my heart is singing, we were right
Oh, if I never knew you
There's no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
Since the moment that we met
I would have no inkling of
If our time has gone too fast
How precious life can be
I've lived at last, yeah yeah
I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright
I thought our love would be so beautiful
We'd turn the darkness into light
And still my heart is singing, we were right
We were right
And If I never knew you
I'd have lived my whole life through
Empty as the sky, never knowing why
Lost forever, if I never knew you, yeah
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, time to fly with T.O.T.S

Let's go!

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, time to fly with...

One, two, three, four!

Soaring through the sky so blue, it's time to fly with T.O.T.S

Bringing babies home to meet their happy moms and pops

Every day feels so sweet, we're making families complete

Captain Beakman: Great work!

Singing, oh, oh oh, oh oh, it's time to fly with T.O.T.S

Deep in the Hundred Acre Wood
Where Christopher Robin plays
You'll find the enchanted neighborhood
Of Christopher's childhood days
A donkey named Eeyore is his friend
And Kanga and little Roo
There's Rabbit and Piglet and there's Owl
But most of all Winnie the Pooh

Chubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff

Oh, this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And they call it Bella Notte

Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely Bella Notte

Side by side with your loved one
You'll find an enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near

So this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely Bella Notte

[DISNEY STUDIO Chorus]
This is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it Bella Notte

Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely Bella Notte
Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantment here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near

Oh, this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely Bella Notte
Robin Hood and Little John, walking through the forest
Laughing back and forth at what the other’n has to say
Reminiscing this and that and having such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

Never ever thinking there was danger in the water
They were drinking, they just guzzled it down
Never dreaming that a scheming sheriff and his posse
Was a-watching them and gathering around

Robin Hood and Little John, running through the forest
Jumping fences, dodging trees and trying to get away
Contemplating nothing but escape and finally making it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day
[Crowd:]
Come one, come all!
Leave your looms and milking stools
Coop the hens and pen the mules

Come one, come all!
Close the churches and the schools
It's the day for breaking rules
Come and join the feast of...

[Clopin:]
Fools!

Once a year we throw a party here in town
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down
Ev'ry man's a king and ev'ry king's a clown
Once again it's Topsy Turvy Day

It's the day the devil in us gets released
It's the day we mock the prig and shock the priest
Ev'rything is topsy turvy at the Feast of Fools!

[Crowd:]
Topsy turvy!

[Clopin:]
Ev'rything is upsy daysy!
[Crowd:]
Topsy turvy!

[Clopin:]
Ev'ryone is acting crazy
Dross is gold and weeds are a bouquet
That's the way on Topsy Turvy Day

[All:]
Topsy Turvy!

[Clopin and Crowd:]
Beat the drums and blow the trumpets

[All:]
Topsy Turvy!

[Clopin and Crowd:]
Join the bums and thieves and strumpets
Streaming in from Chartres to Calais

[Clopin:]
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
On the sixth of "Januervy"

[Clopin and Crowd:]
All because it's Topy Turvy Day!
[Clopin:]
Come one, come all!
Hurry, hurry, here's your chance
See the myst'ry and romance

Come one, come all
See the finest girl in France
Make an entrance to entrance
Dance, la Esmeralda
Dance!

Here it is, the moment you've been waiting for
Here it is, you know exactly what's in store
Now's the time we laugh until our sides get sore
Now's the time we crown the King of Fools!

So make a face that's horrible and frightening
Make a face as gruesome as a gargoyle's wing
For the face that's ugliest will be the King of Fools!
Why?

[Crowd:]
Topsy turvy!

[Clopin:]
Ugly folk, forget your shyness
[Crowd:]
Topsy turvy!

[Clopin:]
You could soon be called Your Highness!

[Crowd:]
Put your foulest features on display
Be the king of Topsy Turvy Day!

[Clopin:]
Ev'rybody!

[Crowd:]
Once a year we throw a party here in town

[Clopin:]
Hail to the king!

[Crowd:]
Once a year we turn all Paris upside down

[Clopin:]
Oh, what a king!

[Crowd:]
Once a year, the ugliest will wear a crown

[Clopin:]
Girls, give a kiss

[Clopin and Crowd:]
Once a year on Topsy Turvy Day

[Clopin:]
We've never had a king like this

[Clopin and Crowd:]
And it's the day we do the things that we deplore
On the other three hundred and sixty-four

Once a year we love to drop in
Where the beer is never stoppin'
For the chance to pop some popinjay
And pick a king who'll put the "top" in
Topsy Turvy Day!

Mad and crazy, upsy-daisy, Topsy Turvy Day!
[Verse 1]
Whatever you do, I'll do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, i just know there's something bigger out there

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Verse 2]
Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Bridge]
Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

[Chorus]
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

[Outro]
...I want to know
[Christopher Robin]
Forever and ever
Is a very long time, Pooh

[Pooh]
Forever isn't long at all
When I'm with you

I wanna call your name, forever
And you will always answer, forever
And both of us will be
Forever you and me
Forever and ever

[Christopher Robin]
I wanna stay like this, forever
If only I could promise forever
Then we could just be we
Forever you and me

[Both]
Forever and ever

[Christopher Robin]
Forever and ever
Is a very long time, Pooh

[Pooh]
Forever isn't long at all, Christopher
When I'm with you

Oh, I wanna be with you, forever
I want you right here, beside me, forever

[Christopher Robin]
One thing you should know
No matter where I go
We'll always be together

[Both]
Forever and ever
Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so he knew ev'ry tree
Kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose
Addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows
So he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

Off through the woods he's a marchin' along
Makin' up yarns an' a singin' a song
Itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong
He's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the buckskin buccaneer!

Andy Jackson is our gen'ral's name
His reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
Them redskin varmints us Volunteers'll tame
'cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim
Davy, Davy Crockett, the champion of us all!~

Headed back to war from the ol' home place
But Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
Fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
South to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down!
Fought single-handed through the Injun War
Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made hisself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

He give his word an' he give his hand
That his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
That justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear!

Home fer the winter with his family
Happy as squirrels in the ol' gum tree
Bein' the father he wanted to be
Close to his boys as the pod an' the pea
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his young'uns dear!

But the ice went out an' the warm winds came
An' the meltin' snow showed tracks of game
An' the flowers of Spring filled the woods with flame
An' all of a sudden life got too tame
Davy, Davy Crockett, headin' on West again!

Off through the woods we're ridin' along
Makin' up yarns an' singin' a song
He's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
An' knows he's right 'cause he ain' often wrong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!
Lookin' fer a place where the air smells clean
Where the trees is tall an' the grass is green
Where the fish is fat in an untouched stream
An' the teemin' woods is a hunter's dream
Davy, Davy Crockett, lookin' fer Paradise!

Now he's lost his love an' his grief was gall
In his heart he wanted to leave it all
An' lose himself in the forests tall
But he answered instead his country's call
Davy, Davy Crockett, beginnin' his campaign!

Needin' his help they didn't vote blind
They put in Davy 'cause he was their kind
Sent up to Nashville the best they could find
A fightin' spirit an' a thinkin' mind
Davy, Davy Crockett, choice of the whole frontier!

The votes were counted an' he won hands down
So they sent him off to Washin'ton town
With his best dress suit still his buckskins brown
A livin' legend of growin' renown
Davy, Davy Crockett, the Canebrake Congressman!

He went off to Congress an' served a spell
Fixin' up the Govern'ments an' laws as well
Took over Washin'ton so we heered tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!
Him an' his jokes travelled all through the land
An' his speeches made him friends to beat the band
His politickin' was their favorite brand
An' everyone wanted to shake his hand
Davy, Davy Crockett, helpin' his legend grow!

He knew when he spoke he sounded the knell
Of his hopes for White House an' fame as well
But he spoke out strong so hist'ry books tell
An' patched up the crack in the Liberty Bell
Davy, Davy Crockett, seein' his duty clear!

When he come home his politickin' done
The western march had just begun
So he packed his gear an' his trusty gun
An' lit out grinnin' to follow the sun
Davy, Davy Crockett, leadin' the pioneer!

He heard of Houston an' Austin so
To the Texas plains he jest had to go
Where freedom was fightin' another foe
An' they needed him at the Alamo
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear!

His land is biggest an' his land is best
From grassy plains to the mountain crest
He's ahead of us all meetin' the test
Followin' his legend into the West
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!

Where the air is deathly still
That is the time when ghosts are present
Practicing their ghoulish delight

When the crypt doors creak
And the tombstones quake
Spooks come out for a swinging wake
Happy haunts materialize
And begin to vocalize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

Now don't close your eyes
And don't try to hide
Or a silly spook may sit by your side
Shrouded in a daft disguise
They pretend to terrorize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
As the moon climbs high o'er the dead oak tree
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes
Start to shriek and harmonize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

When you hear the knell of a requiem bell
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
Restless bones etherialize
Rise as spooks of every size

If we like we stay for maybe quite a while

[SI]
Plenty milk for you and also some for me
Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful, baby
Oh, did your daddy say to listen to your heart?
Be who you are on the inside?
I need three words to tear his argument apart
Your daddy lied

I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't you know?
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
My dinners

You're far too hasty (hasty)
You look tasty (tasty)

Wow, little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch! What a terrible performance
Get the hook! (Get it?)
You don't swing it like you used to, man

Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't

I'm too shiny
I'm the sunrise on the surface of the sea
Look at me, you see I'm so shiny
The monsters see my weaponry and flee
C'est la vie, don't you know
I will shine, shine, shine
Like a rainbow after showers
Your powers will be mine, mine, mine
They'll be mourning you for hours
Bring flowers

Call me selfish (selfish)
Call me shellfish (shellfish)

Far from the gods who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
It's never enough
Love yourself, get your armor up
They can see, your heart is a vacancy

So why not be shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man

You could try, try, try
But I hate negotiations, prostrations
You will die, die, die
Never test a big crustacean's impatience

Unless you have something shiny
Unless you have something shiny

Who's that knockin' at my door?
5, 6, 7, 8
Hurry up and don't be late!
9, 10, 11 ,12
Got a secret I can't tell!
Flap your fins! Flip your tail!
School's out! Ring the bell!

La, la, la, la, Ooooooh
La, la, la, la, Ooooooh
La, la, la, la, Ooooooh
La, la, la, la, Ooooooh

1, 2, 3, 4
Who's that knockin' at my door?

Got a secret I can't tell!
Flap your fins! Flip your tail!
School's out! Ring the bell!
[Intro]
So, ya wanna be a hero, kid? Well, whoop de do
I have been around the block before with blockheads just like you
Each and everyone, a disappointment
Pain for which there ain't no ointment
So much fo excuses though a kid of Zeus
Is asking me to jump into the fray
My answer is two words -
O - kay
You win
Oh gods
Oy vay...

[Verse 1]
I'd given up hope that someone would come along
A fellow who'd ring the bell for once, not the gong
The kind who wins trophies, won't settle for low fees
At least semi-pro fees but no - I get the green horn

[Verse 2]
I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor, a satyr but wiser
A good merchandiser and woah - there goes my ulcer!

[Verse 3]
I'm down to one last hope and I hope it's you
Though kid, you're not exactly a dream come true
I've trained enough turkeys who never came through
You're my one last hope, so you'll have to do!
[Bridge]
Demigods have faced the odds and ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories that you read on all the crockery

[Verse 4]
To be a true hero kid is a dying art
Like painting a masterpiece, it's a work of heart
It takes more than sinew, comes down to what's in you
You have to continue to grow
Now that's more like it!

[Verse 5]
I'm down to one last shot
And my last high note
Before that blasted underworld gets my goat
My dreams are on you, kid -
Go make them come true!
Climb that uphill slope, keep pushing that envelope
You're my one last hope and kid
It's up to you!
Yeah!
[MARCH HARE]
A very merry unbirthday to me

[MAD HATTER]
To who?

[MARCH HARE]
To me!

[MAD HATTER]
Oh, you!

[MARCH HARE]
A very merry unbirthday to you

[MAD HATTER]
Who, me?

[MARCH HARE]
Yes, you!

[MAD HATTER]
Oh, me!

[MARCH HARE]
Let's all congratulate us
With another cup of tea
A very merry unbirthday to me
[MAD HATTER]
Now, statistics prove
Prove that you've
One birthday

[MARCH HARE]
Imagine, just one birthday every year

[MAD HATTER]
But there are 364 unbirthdays

[MARCH HARE]
Precisely why we're gathered here to cheer

[ALICE, spoken]
Why then, today's my unbirthday too!

[MARCH HARE, spoken]
It is?

[MAD HATTER, spoken]
What a small world this is!

[MARCH HARE]
In that case -
A very merry unbirthday
[ALICE]
To me?

[MAD HATTER]
To you!

[MARCH HARE]
A very merry unbirthday

[ALICE]
From me?

[MAD HATTER]
For you!
Now blow the candle out my dear
And make your wish come true

[MARCH HARE/MAD HATTER]
A very merry unbirthday to you!

[DORMOUSE]
Twinkle, twinkle little bat
How I wonder what you're at
Up above the world you fly
Like a tea tray in the sky
[MARCH HARE/MAD HATTER]
A very merry unbirthday to you!
They're black, they're brown, they're up, they're down
They're in, they're out, they're all about
They're far, they're near, they're gone, they're here
They're quick and slick, they're insincere
Beware, Beware, Be a very wary bear

A Heffalump or Woozle, is very confusel
A Heffalump or Woosel's very sly
- sly - sly - sly
They come in ones and twoosels
But if they so choosels
Before your eyes you'll see them multiply
- ply - ply - ply

They're extra-ordinary, so better be wary
Because they come in every shape and size
- size - size - size

If honey's what you covet, you'll find that, they love it
Because they'll guzzle up the thing you prize

They're green they're blue they're pink they're white
They're round they're square they're a terrible sight
They tie themselves in horrible knots
They come in stripes or polka-dots

Beware, Beware, Be a very wary bear. (musical interlude) They're extra-ordinary, so better be wary because they come in every shape and size
- size - size - size

If honey's what you covet, you'll find that, they love it
Because they'll guzzle up the thing you prize

Beware Beware Be a very wary bear

They're extra-ordinary so better be wary
Because they come in every shape and size
- size - size - size

If honey's what you covet you'll find that they love it
Because they guzzle up the things you prize

They're black they're brown they're up their down
They're in they're out they're all about
They're far they're near they're gone they're here
They're quick and slick they're insincere
Beware Beware Beware Beware Beware ...
[Verse 1: Idina Menzel, Anaïs Delva & Willemijn Verkaik]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
Un royaume de solitude
Ma place est là, pour toujours
Der Wind, er heult so wie der Sturm ganz tief in mir
Het werd mij teveel, hoe ik mijn best ook deed

[Pre-Chorus 1: HU Wei Na, Annika Herlitz]
Bié ràng tā men, jìn lái kàn jiàn
Zuò hǎo nǚ hái, jiù xiàng nǐ de cóng qián
Visa ingenting, vad du än gör
Allt är förstört!

[Chorus 1: Takako Matsu, Carmen Sarahí, Kasia Łaska, Füredi Nikolett]
Arino, mama no
Sugata miseru no yo
Libre soy, libre soy
¡Libertad sin vuelta atrás!
Wszystkim wbrew
Na ten gest mnie stać
Jöjjön száz orkán
És közben a szívemen ül a jég

[Verse 2: Gisela]
Desde la distancia
¡Qué pequeño todo es!
I les pors que em dominaven
Per sempre han fugit

[Pre-Chorus 2: Serena Autieri, Hye-Na Park]
Non è un difetto, è una virtù
E non la fermerò mai più
Nae mamdaero chayuropke sallae

[Chorus 2: Jelena Gavrilović, Jobelle Ubalde, Ana Encarnação]
Sad je kraj, sad je krak
Na krilima vetra sam
Seui yik yiu cheui sam gong
Mong diu jok tin bei go
Estou aqui, e vou ficar!
Venha a tempestade

[Bridge: Marsha Milan, Anna Buturlina, Maria Lucia, Nadezhda Panayotova]
Kuasaku buat hidup bercelaru
Podvlastny mne moroz i ljod
Nu chto za divnyj dar
Og som krystaller står
En tanke ganske klar
Shte spra da bada az
Na minaloto plen

[Chorus 3: Lisa Stokke, Gam Wichayanee, Anaïs Delva, Elke Buyle]
La den gå, la den gå
Jeg skal stige lik solen nå
Ploy aok, ma lerk son ren
Dek dee mai hen mi ka
Je suis la coome je l'ai reve
En de storm raast door
De vrieskou daar zat ik toch al niet mee
[Jafar]

I must admit, your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny under your hat!
Now here's your chance to get the best of me
Hope your hand is hot!
C'mon, clown! Let's see what you've got!

You try to slam me with your hardest stuff
But your double whammy isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight, you're simply out of date
You're only second rate!
You think your cat's a meanie, but your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn about the genie game
So for your information, I'll reiterate
You're only second rate!

Men cower at the power in my pinky
My thumb is number one on every list
But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible
Put me to the test!
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest!

Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise
Snap me in a trap, cut me down to size
I'll make a big escape, it's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate!
You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate upon your sorry state
You're only second rate!

Zaba-caba-dabra!
Granny's gonna grab ya!
Alakazam-da-mus
And this thing's bigger than the both of us!

So spare me your tremendous scare!
You look horrendous in your underwear!
And I can hardly wait to discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate
You'll make a better living with a spinning plate
You're only second rate!
Au bout du Pôle Nord ou sur l'Equateur
Au bout du Pôle Nord ou sur l'Equateur
Il y a un Jean qui rit, il y a un Jean qui pleure
Du soleil de midi au soleil de minuit
On a tous la même vie

Car le monde est tout petit
Devant le ciel on se dit
Que nous sommes des fourmis
Le monde est petit

Mari e monti
Non ci dividono
Luna e sole
Sempre risplendono
Se un sorriso farai
In risposta tu avrai
Amicizia e simpatia

E un mondo piccolo
Dopo tutto è piccolo
E un mondo favoloso
Ma è piccolo

En el mundo hay risas y dolor
Esperanzas y hay tambien temor
Mucho hay en verdad
Que poder compartir
Entre la humanidad

Muy pequeño el mundo es
Muy pequeño el mundo es
Debe haber mas hermandad
Muy pequeño es

Es gibt nur einen Mond
Eine Sonne scheint
Und mit einem Lächeln
Ist nur Freundschaft gemeint
Trennen Berge und Meere und Grenzen querfeldein
Diese Welt ist ja so klein

Diese Welt ist klein, so klein
Diese Welt ist fein, so fein
Und in dieser Welt
Da wollen wir Brüder sein

It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small, small world

There is just one moon, and one golden sun
And a smile means friendship to ev'ryone
Though the mountains divide, and the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all

X 2
Hum dum de dum, hum dum de dum
I'm so rumbly in my tumbly
Time to munch an early luncheon
Hum dum de dum, dum

Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree
If a Pooh flew like a bee
But I wouldn't be a bear then
So I guess, I wouldn't care then

Bears love honey and I'm a Pooh bear
So I do care, so I'll climb there
I'm so rumbly in my tumbly
A time for something sweet

Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree
If a Pooh flew like a bee
But I wouldn't be a bear then
So I guess, I wouldn't care then

Bears love honey and I'm a Pooh bear
So I do care, so I'll climb there
I'm so rumbly in my tumbly
A time for something sweet
[MAUI]
We've got a job to do
We need to survive
So you're afraid, good—
That means you're alive

No matter what we face
We run the show
It's time to use your face
To let em know

Now take your fear, pain, joy, rage
Mix 'em up together into something that the world still hasn't seen

[MOANA]
What do you mean?

[MAUI]
Warrior face
Show 'em you mean business
With your warrior face
Put 'em all in line
When you face challenges and dangers
You fix your face to face the world
Prepare your face to face the world

[MOANA]
Wah!

Wah!

Ha!

HA!
[MAUI]

Lower

Stronger

Come on, Moana

Better
[MAUI]
Now make a face that puts the bad guys in their place
'Til they regret the decisions they made that day
That led to standing in your way
Hey

[MAUI]
Warrior face

Teach 'em there's no foolin'
With your warrior face

Show 'em what's in store
Warrior face

Knock 'em back and school 'em
With the face of a warrior
You have the face of a warrior

It doesn't matter how you feel inside
Don't reveal inside
You keep it real inside

You make a face that makes 'em terrified
You make 'em scared inside
Your teeth are bared, alright
[MOANA]

Hah!


Ah!


Woo!







Rah!



Hah!

[MAUI]
We're getting out of here alive

You're gonna help us to survive
[MOANA]

We're getting out of here alive

You're gonna help us survive
[BOTH]
We're getting out of here alive
You're gonna help us to survive
With your—

[MAUI]
Warrior face!

'Til it's second nature
Make your warrior face

Sing your warrior song
Oh that warrior face

Time to demonstrate you've been a warrior all along
You've been a warrior all along
[MOANA]

Hah!


Huh!


Rah!



Hah!

[Brom:]
(spoken)
Just gather round and I'll elucidate
On what goes on outside when it gets late
Along about midnight, the ghosts and banshees
Get together for their nightly jamboree
There's things with horns and saucer eyes
Some with fangs about this size
[Skinny Woman:]
Some are fat
[Fat Woman:]
And some are thin
[Ghoulish Man]
And some don't even wear their skin
[Brom:]
I'm telling ya, brother. It's a frightful sight
To see what goes on Halloween Night

(sung)
When the spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the Headless Horseman, he's the worst

[Chorus:]
That's right, he's a fright
On Halloween night
When he goes a-joggin' 'cross the land
Holdin' his noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And hit the road for parts unknown

[Chorus:]
Beware, take care, he rides alone

[Brom and Chorus:]
And there's no spook like a spook who's spurned
They don't like him, and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get a head

[Brom:]
They say he's tired of his flamin' top
He's got a yen to make a swap
So he rides one night each year
To find a head in the hollow here

[Chorus:]
Now he likes them little, he likes them big
Part in the middle, or a wig
Black or white or even red

[Brom:]
The Headless Horseman needs a head
[Brom and Chorus:]
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out lookin' for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man

[Brom:]
Now if you doubt this tale is so
I met that spook just a year ago
Now I didn't stop for a second look
But made for the bridge that spans the brook
For once you cross that bridge, my friends

[Chorus:]
The ghost is through, his power ends

[Brom:]
So when you're riding home tonight
Make for the bridge with all your might
He'll be down in the hollow there
He needs your head, look out, beware

[Chorus:]
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
[PEG]
What a dog
What a dog

He's a tramp, but they love him
Breaks a new heart every day
He's a tramp, they adore him
And I only hope he'll stay that way

He's a tramp, he's a scoundrel
He's a rounder, he's a cad
He's a tramp, but I love him
Yes, even I have got it pretty bad

You can never tell when he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble
I guess he's just a no-count pup
But I wish that he were double

He's a tramp, he's a rover
And there's nothing more to say
If he's a tramp, he's a good one
And I wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Abandoned by his parents and raised by the gods
Who could see he was destined for greatness
Though he was no bigger than you or me as a baby
He was a demigod!

[Ensemble]
Wow!

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
With lightning speed!
And he gave our people all the things we need, yes indeed
We were crawling on the ground
He looked around and said, "You need a little more space!"
And he raised the sky
So we could walk, so we could fly!

[Ensemble]
We were crawling on the ground
He looked around and said, "You need a little more space!"
And he raised the sky
So we could walk, so we could fly!

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
We were walking in the dark
'Til Maui found a spark, down in the Underworld
He climbed up higher and higher
Bringing the gift of fire

[Ensemble]
We were walking in the dark
'Til Maui found a spark, down in the Underworld
He climbed up higher and higher
Bringing the gift of fire

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
When Maui was around, we were unstoppable
We shattered all the rules, ran free
We tore down every wall
And we answered the call of the sea

We used to sail with gods, we were unstoppable
To islands, we could go explore
With every breaking dawn
Our adventures would go on beyond the shore

Maui taught us how to see the waves
Maui taught us how the sea behaves
Maui taught us how to see the skies
How to see the way the seagull flies

Maui taught us how the stars can guide us
The secrets that the ocean can provide us
How to see our way through wind and rain
And know the way back home is there inside us

We ran the world, we were unstoppable
We learned to sail the seas alone
With every escapade
We were brave and unafraid of the unknown

We gathered up our strength, we were unstoppable
We chased the long horizon line
We faced tremendous odds
But we rumbled with the gods, and we were fine

Hey, master of disguise
He could assume any form, any shape or size
He used to fight fantastic monsters
Take 'em by surprise

[Ensemble]
Master of disguise
He could assume any form, any shape or size
He used to fight fantastic monsters
Take 'em by surprise

[Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Until the fateful night
The only time he ever lost a fight
A thousand years ago
Against a demon named...

[Ensemble]
Te-Pō...
Te-Pō...
Te-Pō...
Te-Pō...

[Lin-Manuel Miranda, spoken]
Te-Pō was a brutal land spirit
Legend says, she devoured Maui whole, and with the disappearance of Maui came the end of our voyages

The villainous Te-Pō did the impossible
And Maui, just like that, was gone
Our demigod, our friend, fought for us until the end
And he lives on

For a thousand years, we have made Motunui our home
But there can be a new Maui, a new generation!

(sung)

I am Moana, I am unstoppable
I know how big the world can be
If Maui lives in you
We can sail across the blue unending sea

We're ready for what's next, we are unstoppable
We want to see the world beyond the shore
For Maui years ago
Taught us everything we know, so let's explore!

We want more
We want more
We want more!
Unstoppable!
[ALICE]
Cats and rabbits
Would reside in fancy little houses
And be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers
In a world of my own

All the flowers
Would have very extra special powers
They would sit and talk to me for hours
When I'm lonely in a world of my own

There'd be new birds
Lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds
Everyone would have a dozen bluebirds
Within that world of my own

I could listen to a babbling brook
And hear a song that I could understand
I keep wishing it could be that way
Because my world would be a Wonderland
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
As you fall all around

Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower
What can compare
To your beautiful sound
Beautiful sound
Beautiful sound
Drip, drop, drip, drop

Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy
Your pretty music
Will brighten the day

Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy
You come along with a song right away
Come with your beautiful music

Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
As you fall all around
Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
What can compare with your beautiful sound

Drip, drip drop
When the sky is cloudy
You come along, come along with your pretty little song
Drip, drip drop
When the sky is cloudy
You come along, come along with your pretty little song

Gay little roundalay
Gay little roundalay
Song of the rainy day
Song of the rainy day
How I love to hear your patter
Pretty little pitter-patter
Helter-skelter when you pelter
Troubles always seem to scatter

Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
As you fall all around
Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
What can compare with your beautiful sound

Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
As you fall all around
Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
What can compare with your beautiful sound
Beautiful sound
[Verse 1: Katie]
Hello little baby
You're a princess just like me
Bet you're thinking maybe
It's a pretty cool thing to be
But soon you'll see that everyone expects a lot from you
They say that there a princess should and shouldn't do

[Chorus: Katie]
But you and me
We, we know better

[2x]
1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crowned together
Always be together, you and me

[Verse 2: Kristen]
They say a princess is full of charm and grace
They say she always knows her place
They say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
They say she never laughs, and snorts milk out her nose

They say she's calm, they say she's kind
They say she never speaks her mind
Or freezes Nanny's big behind!

[Chorus: Together]
But you and me
We, we know better
(Nanny: You girls are in so much trouble, when I tell your father...)
Anna: How come you can do that and I can't?
Elsa: I don't know. I wish you could though.[Verse 3]
They say a princess is super duper sweet
She doesn't fight, she doesn't sweat, and you never see her eat
They say a princess doesn't climb and scrape her knee
They say a princess wouldn't freeze her tutor's tea
They say she poised, they say she's fair
She never mentions underwear!
Or longs to see the world out there...

[Chorus]
But you and me
We...

[Bridge]
Have big ideas of our own
For the distant someday when we're grown
When I'm queen (And I'm your right hand)
You'll get to travel throughout the land!
(I'll them of my sister, and the magic things she can do)
We'll take care of our people
And they will love me and you

[Outro]
No one can tell us what a princess should be
As long as we're together, you and me...

[Ting-Ting]
The life of a princess
From her birth is well defined
She must humbly serve her country
Play the part she's been assigned
She guards the hopes of her people
Weak and mighty, rich and poor

I wanna be like other girls!
Climb up a tree like other girls can

Get to be

[Mei and Su]
To slouch when I sit!
To eat a whole cake!
Feel the sun on my feet!
[Su]
Get dirty!

[Mei]
Act silly!

[Mei and Su]
Be anything I want to be

[Su]
Dance around!

[Mei]
In my underwear!

[Mei and Su]

I'm Abraham deLacy

Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley, the alley cat!

I've got that wanderlust
Gotta walk the scene
Gotta kick up highway dust
Feel the grass that's green
Gotta strut them city streets
Showin' off my éclat, yeah
Tellin' my friends of the social elite
Or some cute cat I happen to meet
That I'm Abraham deLacy
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley, the alley cat!

I'm king of the highway
Prince of the boulevard
Duke of the avant-garde
The world is my backyard
So if you're goin' my way
That's the road you wanna seek
Calcutta to Rome
Or home-sweet-home in Paris
Magnifique, you all
I only got myself
And this big ol' world
When I sip that cup of life
With my fingers curled
I don't worry what road to take
I don't have to think of that
Whatever I take is the road I make
It's the road of life make no mistake, for me
Yeah, Abraham deLacy
Giuseppe Casey
Thomas O'Malley
O'Malley, the alley cat!

That's right
And I'm very proud o' that
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
Oh the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll seek
And it's you who'll climb the mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

[Bridge]
Though there's no one there to guide you
No one to take your hand
But with faith and understanding
You will journey from boy to man

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be
[Verse 2]
In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the
Ones you love
Oh and all the things you dreamed of
The visions that you saw
Well, the time is drawing near now
It's your's to claim it all

[Chorus]
Son of man, look to the sky
Lift your spirit, set it free
Some day you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man, a man in time you'll be

Son of man
Son of man's, a man for all to see
[Instrument Break]

[Verse 1]
In sixteen hundred seven
We sail the open sea
For glory, God, and gold
And The Virginia Company

[Verse 2]
For the New World is like heaven
And we'll all be rich and free
Or so we have been told
By The Virginia Company
So we have been told
By The Virginia Company

[Instrument Break]

[Hook]
For glory, God and gold
And The Virginia Company

[Verse 3]
On the beaches of Virginny
There's diamonds like debris
There's silver rivers flow
And gold you pick right off a tree
[Verse 4]
With a nugget for my Winnie
And another one for me
And all the rest'll go
To The Virginia Company
It's glory, God and gold
And The Virginia Company
So many times out here
I've watched a happy pair
Of lovers walking in the night
They had a kind of glow around them
It almost looked like heaven's light

I knew I'd never know
That warm and loving glow
Though I might wish with all my might
No face as hideous as my face
Was ever meant for heaven's light

But suddenly an angel has smiled at me
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright

I dare to dream that she
Might even care for me
And as I ring these bells tonight
My cold dark tower seems so bright
I swear it must be heaven's light
[Verse 1]
There is a world where hope
And dreams can last for all time
A wondrous place to go
You'll know it when your heart finds

Hearing our song as old as rhyme
Hold my hand we're going to fly
What a magic ride
And just a kiss away

[Chorus]
If you can dream
The wish we're making on a star
Is coming true
The colors of the wind will lead
My heart right back to you
'Cause if you can dream
Reflections in a diamond sky
Come shining on through
Romance will always be so new
And love will save the day
If you can dream

[Verse 2]
Someday my prince will come
It's certain as the sunrise
One day the slipper fits
Then you see the love in his eyes

It's a tale as old as time
There's no mountain we can't climb
When you're finally mine
And just a kiss away

[Chorus]
If you can dream
The wish we're making on a star
Is coming true
The colors of the wind will lead
My heart right back to you
'Cause if you can dream
Reflections in a diamond sky
Come shining on through
Romance will always be so new
And love will save the day
If you can dream

[Bridge]
So the story goes
Never die the rose
There's a whole new world
Waiting there for us
Waiting just for us

[Chorus]
If you can dream
The wish we're making on a star
Is coming true
The colors of the wind will lead
My heart right back to you
'Cause if you can dream
Reflections in a diamond sky
Come shining on through
Romance will always be so new
And love will save the day
If you can dream

[WHITE RABBIT]
I'm late, I'm late
For a very important date
No time to say hello, good-bye
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late

No no no no no no!
I'm overdue!
I'm really in a stew
No time to say goodbye, hello
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late
[ZIRA, spoken]
Hush, my little one
You must be exhausted

(sung)
Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king!

I've been exiled, persecuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense

But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest

The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lionesses' mournful cry
That's my lullaby!

Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is, I know it's petty
But I hate to let them live
[NUKA]
So you found yourself somebody
Who'll chase Simba up a tree

[ZIRA]
Oh, the battle may be bloody
But that kind of works for me

The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby!

Scar is gone, but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
'Til he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!

[NUKA]
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh—I mean, precious little thing

[VITANI]
One day when you're big and strong

[ZIRA]
You will be a king
The pounding of the drums of war!
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar!
[NUKA]
The joy of vengeance!

[VITANI]
Testify!

[ZIRA]
I can hear the cheering

[NUKA &amp; VITANI]
Kovu! What a guy!

[ZIRA]
Payback time is nearing
And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky
That's my lullaby!
FLOWERS:
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips
And the sun is like a toy balloon
There are get up in the morning glories
In the golden afternoon

There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside
Strings of violets are all in tune
Tiger lilies love the dandy lions
In the golden afternoon
(The golden afternoon)

There are dog and caterpillars and the copper centipede
Where the lazy daisies love the very peaceful life
They lead...

You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month of June
There's a wealth of happiness and romance
All in the golden afternoon

All in the golden afternoon
The golden afternoon...

ALICE:
You can learn a lot of things from the flowers
For especially in the month of June
There's a wealth of happiness and romance
All-
FLOWERS:
The golden afternoon!
The second star to the right
Shines in the night for you
To tell you that the dreams you plan
Really can come true

The second star to the right
Shines with a light that's rare
And if it's Never Land you need
It's light will lead you there

Twinkle, twinkle little star
So I'll know where you are
Gleaming in the skies above
Lead me to the land we dream of

And when our journey is through
Each time we say "Goodnight"
We'll thank the little star that shines
The second from the right
[Pip]
Like a rocket through the sky, we go!

La la la la dah dah dah
Bringin’ this baby home!
Bringin’ this baby home!
Ah, Salaam and Good Evening to you, my dear friend.
Please, please come closer...

[Camera hits Peddler]

Ah uh, too close, a little to close...

[Camera pulls back]

There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment...

[takes out a table full of stuff]

And the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today! Come on down, heh heh... Look at this, yes, he he,
combination hooka and coffee maker, also makes julienne fries! It will not break! It will not... It broke.

Oh, look at this, I have never seen one of these intact before... This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen *pfft* ah, still good. Ha ha.

[Camera starts leaving]

Wait, don't go! I can see that you are only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you will be most rewarded to consider this.

[Takes out a lamp]

Do not be fooled by its common-place appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that
counts. This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of
a young man's life. A young man, who like this lamp, was more than what he seemed... A diamond in the rough.

[CINDERELLA]
Mmmmmm

So this is love
[VOICE OF WIND]
Ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ya

[GRANDMOTHER WILLOW]
Que que na-to-ra, you will understand
Listen with your heart, you will understand
Let it break upon you, like a wave upon the sand
Listen with your heart, you will understand

[VOICE OF WIND]
You will understand
[NARRATOR]
T'was a long time ago, longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams
For the story that you are about to be told
Began with the holiday worlds of old

Now you've probably wondered where holidays come from
If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun
For the holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work for the worlds that create them for us

Well, you see now, quite simply that's all that they do
Making one unique holiday especially for you
But once a calamity ever so great
Occurred when two holidays met by mistake
[Verse 1: Sabrina Carpenter]
Hello, my name is Jenny Parker and these kids are my crew
We're in a lot of trouble and I'm not sure what to do
See it all started, when our phones made a switch
Lola lied to the parents, she's been a real witch
Kid snuck out, the kitchen caught fire
The car got towed, all because she's a liar

[Verse 2: Jet Jurgensmeyer]
Now these bad guys are chasing us

[Verse 3: Mallory James]
We Almost Just Died

[Verse 4: Nikki Hahn, Sofia Carson]
I Got A Tattoo
Can you that one slide

[Verse 5: Sabrina Carpenter]
This girl is ruining my life, my job, my reputation
And if we ever get home, I'm gonna need a vacation
But no matter what, I won't be a quitter
Gonna care for these kids, cause I'm a ba-by-sitter

[Hook: Jet &amp; Mallory]
She ain't no quitter
She's the babysitter
(Repeat x4)
[Verse 6: Sofia Carson]
Hold up just a minute, that's not the straight scoop
This girl's so uptight, she's all tied in a loop

[Break]
Looks Like we have our selfs a Rap Battle!

[Verse 7: Sofia Carson (Kevin Quinn)]
Uh, let's rewind this movie an hour or two
The kid snuck out, I didn't have a clue. (Kevin Quinn: Yeah, That's true)
Okay I admit it, I don't follow rules
I'm not good with kids, I'm not good at school
It wasn't my plan to steal a car
Or end up in jail or take it this far
It's true, I lied, but nobody's died
And these kids are having an incredible ride

[Verse 8: Sabrina Carpenter]
You think you know it all, but you don't know me
See I'm more than just, Miss Spelling Bee

[Verse 9: Sofia Carson]
Wanna be a real artist
Take pictures, Get gritty
On your first night out in the big, bad city
You're a cool girl, Jenny
But I'm pretty cool too
In fact,  I'm just as a great as a
Babysitter as you, ha
[Verse 10: Sabrina Carpenter]
She's right. I'm smart and I do follow rules
I work real hard, and I care about school
There's a time for fun, to let go and climb trees
But I am a real artist, everybody say "Cheese."

[Hook: Sofia, Mallory, Jet &amp; Sabrina]
They ain't no quitter
Their the babysitters
(Repeat x4)

[Bridge: Everybody]
We're ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters
We ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters
We're the babysitters
(Repeat x3)
We ain't no quitters
We're the babysitters
Up, down, up
When I up, down, touch the ground it puts me in the mood
Up, down, touch the ground, in the mood (he, he, he) for food
I am stout, round and I have found, speaking poundage wise
I improve my appetite when I exercise
I am short, fat and proud of that and so with all my might
I up, down and up and down to my appetite's delight
While I up, down and touch the ground, I think of things to chew (Like honey)
With a hefty, healthy appetite I'm a hefty happy pooh
[Ratcliffe]
The gold of Cortes
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets
By this time tomorrow

The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far
Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys
Dig up Virginia, boys

Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain
And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine

[English Settlers]
Dig and dig and dig and diggety ...
Dig and dig and dig and diggety ...

[Wiggins]
Hey nonny nonny
Hiy nonny nonny

[Ratcliffe]
Oh, how I love it!

[Wiggins]
Hey nonny nonny
Hiy nonny nonny

[Ratcliffe]
Riches for cheap!

[Wiggins]
Hey nonny nonny
Hiy nonny nonny
There'll be heaps of it ...

[Ratcliffe]
And I'll be on top of the heap!

My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter!
The ladies at court
Will be all a-twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me—no, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mine
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets, dug, it's

Glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine

[English Settlers]
Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig!

[John Smith]
All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

Keep on working, lads (Mine)
Don't be shirking, lads
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
Mine
Find a mother lode
Then find another load!
Dig! Dig! and diggety
Dig! Dig! for that gold
All
Make this island my land!
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine

This land we behold...
—This beauty untold...
A man can be bold!
—It all can be sold!

And the gold
Is ...
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
So go for the gold
We know which is here
All the riches here
From this minute
This land and what's in it is mine!
Dig and dig and diggety-dig!
Hey nonny nonny nonny it's mine!
[Narrator]
Long ago
In the faraway land of ancient Greece
There was a golden age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes
And the greatest and strongest of all these heroes
Was the mighty Hercules

But what is the measure of a true hero?
Now that is where our story-

[Thalia]
Would you listen to him?
He's making our story sound like some Greek tragedy

[Terpsichore]
Lighten up dude!

[Calliope]
We'll take it from here darling
Be brave, little one
Make a wish for each sad little tear
Hold your head up, though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you

Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you

Always keep a little prayer in your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll be joy and happiness
And your little world will be bright

Have faith, little one
'Til your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave, little one
Someone's waiting to love you
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Or, The Story of the Curious Oysters

The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night

The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
The beach was wide
From side to side
But much too full of sand

"Mr. Walrus," said the Carpenter
"My brain begins to perk
We'll sweep this clear in 'alf a year
If you don't mind the work"

"Work?! The time has come," the Walrus said
"To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings
Calloo-Callay
No work today!
We're cabbages and kings"
Oh, uh, Oysters, come and walk with us
The day is warm and bright
A pleasant walk
A pleasant talk
Would be a sheer delight
Yes, and should we get hungry on the way
We'll stop and, uh, have a bite?

But Mother Oyster winked her eye
And shook her hairy head
She knew too well
This was no time to leave her Oyster bed
"The sea is nice
Take my advice
And stay right here," Mum said

Yes, yes, of course, of course, but, uh, ha, ha
The time has come, my little friends
To talk of other things
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings, ha ha
Callo-Callay
Come, run away
With cabbages and kings!
Well, now, uh, let me see
Ah, a loaf of bread is
What we chiefly need!
Listen, how 'bout some pepper and salt and vinegar, eh?
Well, yes, yes, splendid idea, ha ha!
Very good, indeed
Now, if your ready, Oysters, dear
We can begin the feed
Feed?!

Oh, yes, the time has come, my little friends
To talk of food and things
Of peppercorns and mustard seeds
And other seasonings!
We'll mix 'em all together
In a sauce that's fit for kings
Calloo-Callay
We'll eat today
Like cabbages and kings!

I, uh, weep for you. I (hic), oh excuse me
I deeply sympathise
For I've enjoyed your company, oh much more
Than you realize
Little Oysters? Little Oysters?
But answer, there came none
And this was scarcely odd because
They'd been eaten
Every one!

With cabbages and kings!
The End!
[Verse 1]
There's a place where the crazy moon
Makes the monkeys sing (Ah-ah-ah!)
And the baboons swoon
And the sultry scent of the lotus bloom
Will carry you away
While the hippos swing from the jungle vines
And the rhino rumba in a conga line
All the pink flamingos are intertwined
As the stars come out to play!

[Chorus]
Uh!
In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine (So divine)
That you'll lose your mind (Lose your mind)
As it sweeps you off your feet
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will lead you there
(In Upendi, in Upendi)

[Verse 2]
You better watch your step
'Cause the path is steep
You better hold your breath
'Cause the water's deep
It's a long way down off of lover's leap
But falling's half the fun!

[Chorus]
In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you'll lose your mind (Lose your mind)
As it sweeps you off your feet (Sweeps you off your feet)
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will take you there

[Bridge]
You can beat the bush like there's no tomorrow
From Tanganyika to Kilimanjaro!
But you'll find Upendi wherever you are
Oh, underneath the sun (Sun!)

[Chorus]
In Upendi
Where the passion fruit grows sweet
And it's so divine
That you'll lose your mind (Lose your mind)
As it sweeps you off your feet (Sweeps you off your feet)
In Upendi
Without a worry or a care
It just takes two
To make it true
Your heart will take you there

[Outro]
Upendi
Down in Upendi
Way down in Upendi
Down in Upendi
Way down in Upendi
Down in Upendi
Way down in Upendi
Down in Upendi
Way down in Upendi

(In Upendi!)
(In Upendi!)
(In Upendi!)
(In Upendi!)
(JIMINY and PINOCCHIO whistling)

[JIMINY, spoken]
That's it! Come on now! Lets sing it!

(sung)
When you get in trouble
And you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle, give a little whistle

When you meet temptation
And the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle, give a little whistle

Not just a little squeak, pucker up and blow
And if your whistle is weak, yell

[PINOCCHIO, spoken]
Jiminy Cricket?

[JIMINY, spoken]
Right!

(sung)
Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide
Give a little whistle, give a little whistle
And always let your conscience be your guide
Take the strait and narrow path
And if you start to slide
Give a little whistle (yoo-hoo)
Give a little whistle (yoo-HOO!)
And always let your conscience be your guide

[PINOCCHIO]
And always let your conscience be your guide!
[JACK]
What have I done? What have I done?
How could I be so blind?
All is lost, where was I?
Spoiled all, spoiled all
Everything's gone all wrong

What have I done? What have I done?
Find a deep cave to hide in
In a million years, they'll find me
Only dust and a plaque that reads
'Here Lies Poor Old Jack'

But I never intended all this madness, never
And nobody really understood, well, how could they?
That all I ever wanted was to bring them something great
Why does nothing ever turn out like it should?

Well, what the heck? I went and did my best
And my God, I really tasted something swell, that's right
And for a moment, why, I even touched the sky
And at least I left some stories they can tell, I did

And for the first time since I don't remember when
I felt just like my old bony self again
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
That's right, I am the Pumpkin King, haha
And I just can't wait until next Halloween
Cause I've got some new ideas
That will really make them scream
And my God I'm really gonna give it all my might
Uh, oh, I hope there's still time to set things right
Sandy Claws, hmm
We're on our way

The voyage starts with open hearts
We set a course and head for parts unknown
A new adventure to learn about new cultures
And leave behind the world we've always known

Come join us on our journey!

We're on our way
We're on our way
Together we can change the world and find a brighter day
Let's celebrate
Let's dance and play
To the rhythm of the world we find today
We're on our way
We're on our way

Come join us on our journey!

We're on our way
We're on our way
A new adventure calls to us - let it begin today!
We journey on and celebrate the spirit of adventure as we say
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way

(as the show comes to a close, the song is reprised with different lyrics as "We Found Our Way")

We found our way
We found our way
Our world is one big family
We make a brighter day
And then we say: Let's celebrate!
New friends we meet are different but the same
We found our way

The ending to our journey

We found our way
We found our way
Our world is one big family
We make a brighter day
And then we say: Let's celebrate!
New friends we meet are different but the same
We found our way
[Verse 1]
When the moon is full and bright
On a starry, starry night
And the wind is deadly still
Down your spine you feel a chill
Something spooky's in the air
You look around and no one's there
Not a living soul in sight
Are there spirits out tonight?

[Pre-Chorus]
Then a bell starts to ring
All the ghosts come out to sing

[Chorus]
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
Let out a scream (Whoo!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(It's Halloween!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Halloween!)

[Verse 2]
From the mansion on the hill
Shrieks of laughter break the still
Ghoulish figures start to wake
Makes your knees begin to quake
Ghostly music fills the air
With minor chords to curl your hair
Ghosts and goblins boogie-shake
To a devilish disco wake

[Pre-Chorus]
Then a bell starts to ring
All the ghosts come out to sing
(Ooo...)

[Chorus]
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
Let out a scream (Waaah!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(It's Halloween!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
(Yeah!)
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(It's Halloween!)

It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
Let out a scream (Yaaah!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(Oh-ohhh!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
(Yeah!)
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Oh!)

[Bridge]
If you're young or if you're old
Don't be left out in the cold
For one night out of the year
Hug a goblin without fear
Don a costume and a wig
And dance a Halloween-y jig
Shake it left and shake it right
'Cause it's Halloween tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
When a bell begins to ring
Everybody start to sing
(Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it! Oh!)

[Chorus]
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
Let out a scream (Whoo!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(It's Halloween!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Yeah! Yeah!)

It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(It's Halloween!)
Let out a scream (Whoo!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Whoo!)

It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
Let out a scream
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(Hooray, it's Halloween!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
It's Halloween
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Come on, come on!)

It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
Let out a scream (Whoo!)
Hooray, it's Halloween!
(It's Halloween!)
It's Halloween-lo-ween everybody
(Everybody!)
It's Halloween
(Whoo! Whoo!)
Give a scream, it's Halloween!
(Oh!)
Ariel, escuchame, este mundo esta muy mal
La vida debajo del mar es mucho mejor que el mundo de allá arriba

Tú crees que en otros lados las algas más verdes son
Y sueñas con ir arriba que gran equivocación
No ves que tu propio mundo no tiene comparación
Qué puede haber allá afuera que cause tal emoción

Bajo del mar, bajo del mar
Vive contenta siendo sirena eres feliz
Sé que trabajan sin parar y bajo el sol para variar
Mientras nosotros siempre flotamos bajo del mar
Los peces son my felizes aquí tienen libertad
Los peces allá estan tristes, sus casas son de cristal
La vida de nuestros peces muy larga no suele ser
Si al dueño le apetece "a mi me van a comer"

Bajo del mar, bajo del mar
Nadie nos frie ni nos cocina en un sarten
Si no te quieres arriesgar bajo del mar te quedaras
Y sin problemas entre burbujas tu viviras

(bajo del mar) Bajo del mar
(bajo del mar) Bajo del mar
Hay siempre ritmo en nuestro mundo al natural (al natural)
La mantarraya tocara y el esturión se le unira
Siempre al ritmo, ritmo marino
Bajo del mar

Oye la flauta, oye el arpa y al contrabajo ponle atención
Veras las trompes y el tambor disfruta de tu canción
Con la marimba y el violín, las truchas bailando y otros cantando
Y no olvidarnos de espadín que empieze la función

Bajo del mar, bajo del mar
Hay bailarinas son las sardinas ven a bailar
Para qué quieres explorar si nuestra banda va a tocar
Hay castañuelas son las almejas bajo del mar

Y las almejas son tan jocosas, bajo del mar
El caracol es saxofonista
Y las burbujas llenan la pista para que bailes en esta fiesta
Bajo del mar
[JACK]
(spoken) Listen, everyone

There were objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain

It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream

But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist

(spoken) Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

[HARLEQUIN DEMON]
A box?

[DEVIL]
Is it steel?
[WEREWOLF]
Are there locks?

[HARLEQUIN DEMON]
Is it filled with a pox?

[DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON]
A pox
How delightful, a pox

[JACK]
(spoken) If you please...

Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

[WITCHES]
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

[JACK]
That's the point of the thing, not to know!
[CLOWN]
It's a bat

[CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS]
Will it bend?

[CLOWN]
It's a rat!

[CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS]
Will it break?

[MONSTER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON]
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake?

[JACK]
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

(spoken) Now, pay attention

We pick up an over-sized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

[MR. HYDE]
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?
[MEDIUM MR. HYDE]
Let me see, let me look

[SMALL MR. HYDE]
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

[JACK]
(spoken) Um, let me explain...

There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

[MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON]
Small toys

[WINGED DEMON]
Do they bite?

[MUMMY]
Do they snap?

[WINGED DEMON]
Or explode in a sack?

[CORPSE KID]
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

[MAYOR]
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

[JACK]
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp

(spoken) Well, I may as well give them what they want...

And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
And he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land

(spoken) Oh, well...
[WENDY, spoken]
But Peter, how do we get to Neverland?

[PETER, spoken]
Fly of course

[WENDY, spoken]
Fly?

[PETER, spoken]
It's easy!  All you have to do is...to...is to...is...to...huh!  That's funny!

[WENDY, spoken]
What's the matter?  Don't you know?

[PETER, spoken]
Well, sure!  It's just that I never thought about it before.  Say, that's it!  You think of a wonderful thought!

[CHILDREN, spoken]
Any happy little thought?

[PETER, spoken]
Uh, huh!

[WENDY, spoken]
Like toys at Christmas, sleigh bells, snow?

[PETER, spoken]
Yup, watch me now, here I go!  It's easier than pie!

[WENDY, spoken]
He can fly!

[JOHN, spoken]
He can fly!

[MICHAEL, spoken]
He flew!

[PETER, spoken]
Now you try

[WENDY, spoken]
I'll think of a mermaid's lagoon
Underneath a magic moon

[JOHN, spoken]
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave

[MICHAEL, spoken]
I'll think I'll be a Indian brave

[PETER, spoken]
Now everybody try...

[ALL]
One, two, three...
We can fly, we can fly, we can....

[PETER, spoken]
This won't do
What's the matter with you?
All it take is faith, trust
Oh, and something I forgot!
Dust!

[CHILDREN, spoken]
Dust

[MICHAEL, spoken]
Dust!

[PETER, spoken]
Yep, just a little bit of pixie dust
Now, think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings

[WENDY, spoken]
Lets all try it, just once more

[JOHN, spoken]
Look we're rising off the floor

[MICHAEL, spoken]
Jiminy!

[WENDY, spoken]
Oh, my!  We can fly!

[PETER, spoken]
You can fly!

[CHILDREN, spoken]
We can fly!

Come on, everybody!
Here we go!
Off to Neverland!

[Chorus]
Think of the presents you've brought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells, here we go
Like a reindeer in the sky

You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

Soon you'll zoom all around the room
All it takes is faith and trust
But the thing that's a positive must
Is a little bit of pixie dust
The dust is a positive must

You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
It's a very simple plan
You can do what the birdies can
At least it's worth a try

You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly
[Clopin and Gypsies]
Maybe you've heard of a terrible place
Where the scoundrels of Paris
Collect in a lair

Maybe you've heard of that mythical place
Called the Court of Miracles

[Clopin]
Hello, you're there!

[Gypsies]
Where the lame can walk
And the blind can see

[Clopin]
But the dead don't talk
So you won't be around
To reveal what you've found

[Clopin and Gypsies]
We have a method for spies and intruders
Rather like hornets protecting their hive
Here in the Court of Miracles
Where it's a miracle if you get out alive!

[Clopin]
Justice is swift in the Court of Miracles
I am the lawyers and judge all in one
We like to get the trial over with quickly
Because it's the sentence that's really the fun!

Now that we've seen all the evidence

[Puppet]
Wait! I object!

[Clopin]
Overruled!

[Puppet]
I object!

[Clopin]
Quiet!

[Puppet]
Dang!

[Clopin]
We find you totally innocent
Which is the worst crime of all

[All]
So you're going to hang!
[Clopin:]
So here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
What makes a monster and what makes a man?

[Chorus:]
Sing the bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells

[Clopin:]
Whatever their pitch
You can feel them bewitch you
The rich and the ritual knells
Of the bells of Notre Dame
Which pets' address is the finest in Paris?
Which pets possess the longest pedigree?
Which pets get to sleep on velvet mats?
Naturalment! The aristocats!

Which pets are blessed with the fairest forms and faces?
Which pets know best all the gentle social graces?
Which pets live on cream and loving pats?
Naturalment! The aristocats!

They show aristoc'atic bearing
When they're seen upon an airing
And aristoc'atic flair in what they do
And what they say

Aristocats are never found
In alleyways or hanging around
The garbage cans where
Common kitties play, oh no!

Which pets are known to never show their claws?
Which pets are prone to hardly any flaws?
To which pets do the others tip their hats?
Naturalment! The aristocats!

They show aristoc'atic bearing
When they're seen upon an airing
And aristoc'atic flair in what they do
And what they say
Aristocats are never found
In alleyways or hanging around
The garbage cans where
Common kitties play, oh no!

Which pets are known to never show their claws?
Which pets are prone to hardly any flaws?
To which pets do the others tip their hats?
Mais naturellement, voyons
Mais naturellement
Oh, naturellement
The aristocats!
The earth is cold
The fields are bare
The branches fold against the wind that's everywhere

The birds move on
So they survive
When snow so deep
The bears all sleep to keep themselves alive

They do what they must for now
And trust in their plan
If I trust in mine, somehow I might find who I am

But where do I go from here?
So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?

My world has changed and so have I
I've learned to choose
And even learned to say goodbye

The path ahead's so hard to see
It winds and bends but where it ends
Depends on only me
In my heart I don't feel part of so much I've known
Now it seems it's time to start
A new life on my own

But where do I go from here?
So many voices ringing in my ear
Which is the voice that I was meant to hear?
How will I know?
Where do I go from here?
[Chorus]
So this is love, mhm
So this is love

[Verse]
So this is what makes life divine
I'm all aglow, mhm
And now I know
The key to all heaven is mine
My heart has wings, mhm
And I can fly
I'll touch every star in the sky
So this is the miracle that I've been dreaming of

[Chorus]
Mhm, mhm
So this is love
[VAMPIRES]
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever
Going to get him back

[WEREWOLF]
He's all alone up there
Locked away inside

[CORPSE MOTHER]
Never says a word

[CORPSE KID]
Hope he hasn't died

[CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN]
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

[JACK]
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There are so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

(Spoken) What does it mean? Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it

You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
(spoken) Hee, hee, hee, hee! Eureka! I've got it! This year, Christmas will be ours!
[Tip]
Taming the tides, swarming the seas
Beware barracudas, drop to your knee
Defending our friends and anemones
As big as a whale

[Melody]
But with a much smaller tail

[Tip]
Facing the foe with our fearless flukes
Daring the dastards to put up their dukes
Great globs of gore, we'll storm the shore
And seek the unknown

[Dash]
Then can we go home?

[Tip and Dash]
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers
Our gallant quest to do our best
And smile for our adorers

[Melody]
We'll save the day

[Dash]
And make a splash

[Tip]
Titanic Tip

[Tip and Dash]
And Daring Dash

[Tip]
We'll clobber those crabs with their clammy claws

[Dash]
We'll sever those sharks with their savage jaws

[Tip]
The battle is fierce

[Dash]
And mercifully brief

[Melody]
The conquering heroes return as kings of the reef

[Tip]
We'll dine with the best, dressed with a flair
Climb every mountain because it's there
Come on, follow me, we'll make history
To courage, to us

[Melody]
The trident

[Dash]
Or bust!

[All three together]
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers
Titanic Tip and Daring Dash
Adventurers slash explorers

[Tip]
We'll save the day and make a splash

[Melody]
Melody

[Tip]
Tip

[Dash]
And Daring Dash

[All three together]
All for three and three for one
Atlantica, here we come!
[JAQ]
Every time she'd find a minute
That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly

[STEPSISTERS]
Cinderella!

[JAQ]
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping

[MICE]
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping

[JAQ]
She goes around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler

[MICE]
Keep a-busy Cinderelly!
[JAQ, spoken]
Yea, keep her busy.  You know what?  Cinderelly not go to the ball

[MICE, spoken]
What?  Not go?  What did you say?

[JAQ, spoken]
You'll see.  They fix her.  Work, work, work.  She'll never get her dress done

[GUS, spoken]
Poor Cinderelly

[SUSIE, spoken]
Hey, we can do it!
(sung)
We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really

[MICE]
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball
She'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'

[GUS]
I'll cut with these scissors!

[JAQ]
And I can do the sewing!

[SUSIE]
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'

[MICE]
And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly!
We'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly!

(Instrumental Sequence)

[MICE]
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for, you keep
[SUSIE]
Have faith in your dreams and someday
(whistling)
No matter how your heart is grieving

[GUS]
If you keep on believing

[JAQ]
The dream that you wish will come true

(vocalizing)

[SUSIE, spoken]
Okay...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

[JAQ/GUS]
Whatever you wish for you keep

[MICE, spoken]
Heave ho!  Heave ho!

(vocalizing)

[SUSIE]
The dream that you wish will come true
[Instrumental]
[Ratcliffe]
What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin, as I said
And worse

[English Settlers]
They're savages! Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
Barely even human

[English Settlers]
Savages! Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums of war!

[English Settlers]
They're savages! Savages!
Dirty redskin devils!
Now we sound the drums of war!
[Powhatan]
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed

[Kekata]
Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside

[Native Americans]
I wonder if they even bleed

They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!

[Powhatan]
Killers at the core

[Kekata]
They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted

[Powhatan]
We must sound the drums of war
[Native Americans]
They're savages! Savages!
First we deal with this one

[All]
Then we sound the drums of war

[English Settlers]
Savages! Savages!

[Ben]
Let's go kill a few, men!

[Native Americans]
Savages! Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
Now it's up to you, men!

[All]
Savages! Savages!
Barely even human!
Now we sound the drums of war!
[HUGO]
Paris, the city of lovers is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire, but still, there's "l'amour"
Somewhere out there in the night
Her heart is also alight
And I know the guy she just might be burning for!

A guy like you
She's never known, kid
A guy like you
A girl does not meet every day

You've got a look
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two...?

[VICTOR & LAVERNE]
Like you?

[ALL]
No way!

[HUGO]
Those other guys
That she could dangle
All look the same
From every boring point of view!
You're a surprise
From every angle
Mon Dieu above
She's gotta love a guy like you

[VICTOR]
A guy like you
Gets extra credit
Because it's true
You've got a certain something more!

[HUGO]
You're aces, kid

[LAVERNE]
You see that face
You don't forget it

[VICTOR & LAVERNE]
Want something new?

[HUGO]
That's you

[ALL]
For sure!

[LAVERNE]
We all have gaped
At some Adonis

[VICTOR]
But then we crave a meal
More nourishing to chew

[HUGO]
And since you've shaped
Like a croissant is

[ALL]
No question of
She's gotta love
A guy like you!

[LAVERNE]
Call me a hopeless romatic
But Quasi, I feel it

[VICTOR]
She wants you so, any moment
She'll walk through that door

[ALL]
For—

[HUGO]
A guy so swell

With all you bring her

A fool could tell
It's why she fell
For you-know-who!
 
[VICTOR & LAVERNE]
A guy like you
I tell you Quasi
There never was
Another, was he?
From king to serf
To the bourgeoisie
We notice every string there!
[HUGO]
You ring the bell

[ALL]
You're the bell ringer!
When she wants ooh-la-la
Then she wants you-la-la
She will discover, guy
You're one heck of a guy
Who wouldn't love a guy
Like you?

[HUGO]
You got a lot

[VICTOR]
The rest have not

[HUGO]
So she's gotta love
A guy like...

[ALL]
... you!
[Ratcliffe]
This will be the day ...

(spoken)
Let's go men!

[Powhatan]
This will be the morning ...

(spoken)
Bring out the prisoner

[English Settlers & Native Americans]
We will see them dying in the dust

[Pocahontas]
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try

[English Settlers]
Now we make 'em pay

[Pocahontas]
Eagle, help my feet to fly

[Native Americans]
Now without a warning...

[Pocahontas]
Mountain, help my heart be great

[English Settlers and Native Americans]
Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust

[Pocahontas]
Spirits of the earth and sky...

[English Settlers & Native Americans]
It's them or us

[Pocahontas]
Please don't let it be to late ...

[English Settlers & Native Americans]
They're just a bunch of
Filthy, stinking

[English Settlers]
Savages!

[Native Americans]
Savages!

[English Settlers]
Demons!

[Native Americans]
Devils!

[Ratcliffe]
Kill them!

[Native Americans]
Savages!

[English Settlers]
Savages!

[Ratcliffe]
What are we waiting for?

[All]
Destroy their evil race
Until there's not a trace left

[Pocahontas]
How loud are the drums of war

[English Settlers & Native Americans]
We will sound the drums of war
(Savages! Savages!)
Now, we sound the drums of war
(Savages! Savages!)

[Ratcliffe]
Now we see what comes
Of trying to be chums

[Native Americans]
Now we sound the drums ... of ... war!

[English Settlers]
Of course it means the drums ... of ... war!

[Pocahontas]
Is the death of all I love
Carried in the drumming of war?
Come meet with mystery
Come cheat reality
Wondrous, surprising
So mesmerising

Sway with sensation
Sweet liberation
Breathlessly quick
Envie de magic!
Dazzling, hypnotic
Envie de magic!

Ce rêve bleu
C'est un nouveau monde en couleur
Nous partageons ce rêve bleu a deux

My oh my, what a wonderful day
Plenty of sunshine
Headin' my way
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah
Zip-a-dee-ay

Ce rêve bleu
Ce rêve bleu
Ce rêve bleu

It's calling (Magie!)
Glittering and revealing
You're falling (Magie!)
Delirious with the feeling - let it go! (Magie!)
You can't resist it now
Falling (Magie!)
Free your imagination
Come chase it! (Cherche-là!)
Face it! (Trouve-là!)
Embrace it! (Embrasse-là!)
L'envie de magie est là!

Lost in the magic
Lost in the magic
Dazzling, hypnotic
Lost in the magic
I'm falling
Envie de magie!
[Glenn Close]
Come stop your crying, it'll be alright
Just take my hand, hold it tight
I will protect you from all around you
I will be here, don't you cry

[Phil Collins]
For one so small, you seem so strong
My arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm
This bond between us can't be broken
I will be here, don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on, now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always

[Glenn Close]
Always
[Verse 1]
大家同心作戰 讓匈奴絕望
為何這群士兵都像個姑娘
你們笨拙散漫又扭徨
我會改變你的前途
要成為男子漢不認輸

[Verse 2]
紮穩你的步履 內心要堅定
開闊你的胸襟 求勝要決心
膽小又害怕 心亂如麻
你驚慌茫然無助
要成為男子漢不認輸

[Bridge]
我氣喘如牛快斷氣
西方極樂等我光臨
我看大家全都被他嚇傻了
他們膽戰又心驚
他的身份還是秘密
掉到水裏可會要了我小命

[Chorus]
男子漢
行動快速像那江河湍急
男子漢
破壞力像那風暴無情
男子漢
滿腔熱血像那野火壓境
神出鬼沒像那暗夜的惡夢

[Verse 3]
時光毫不留情匈奴快逼近
聽從我的指令才能夠活命
沙場太殘酷 血光殺戮
若害怕踏上歸路
要成為男子漢不認輸

[Chorus]
男子漢
行動快速像那江河湍急
男子漢
破壞力像那風暴無情
男子漢
滿腔熱血像那野火壓境
神出鬼沒像那暗夜的惡夢

男子漢
行動快速像那江河湍急
男子漢
破壞力像那風暴無情
男子漢
滿腔熱血像那野火壓境
神出鬼沒像那暗夜的惡夢
There's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow
Shining at the end of every day
There's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow
And tomorrow's just a dream away

Man has a dream and that's the start
He follows his dream with mind and heart
And when it becomes a reality
It's a dream come true for you and me

So there's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow
Shining at the end of every day
There's a great, big, beautiful tomorrow
Just a dream away
[Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Jack's OK, and he's back, OK

[CORPSE KID &amp; Chorus]
He's all right

[MAYOR &amp; Chorus]
Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, wheee

[Chorus]
Jack is back now, everyone sing
In our town of Halloween

[CORPSE KID]
What's this?

[MUMMY]
What's this?

[HARLEQUIN DEMON]
I haven't got a clue
[MR. HYDE]
What's this?

[CLOWN]
Why it's completely new

[OFF-SCREEN VOICE]
What's this?

[WEREWOLF]
Must be a Christmas thing

[OFF-SCREEN VOICE]
What's this?

[MAYOR]
It's really very strange

[Chorus]
This is Halloween
Halloween! Halloween! Halloween!

What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
What's this?
[JACK]
My dearest friend, if you don't mind
I'd like to join you by your side
Where we can gaze into the stars

[JACK &amp; SALLY]
And sit together, now and forever
For it is plain as anyone can see
We're simply meant to be
Never smile at a crocodile
No, you can't get friendly with a crocodile
Don't be taken in by his welcome grin
He's imagining how well you'd fit within his skin
Never smile at a crocodile
Never tip your hat and stop to talk awhile
Never run, walk away, say good-night, not good-day
Clear the aisle but never smile at Mister Crocodile
You may very well be well bred
Lots ot etiquette in your head
But there's always some special case, time or place
To forget etiquette
For instance:
Never smile at a crocodile
No, you can't get friendly with a crocodile
Don't be taken in by his welcome grin
He's imagining how well you'd fit within his skin
Never smile at a crocodile
Never dip your hat and stop to talk awhile
Never run, walk away, say good-night, not good-day
Clear the aisle but never smile at Mister Crocodile
[Townspeople and Narrator:]
Who's that coming down the street?
Are they shovels or are they feet?
Lean and lanky, skin and bone
With clothes a scarecrow would hate to own

[Narrator:]
Yet he has a certain air

[Townspeople:]
Debonair and devil-may-care

[Woman #1:]
It's the new school-master

[Woman #2:]
What's his name?

[Ichabod:]
Ichabod
Ichabod Crane

[Townspeople:]
Ichabod, what a name
Kind of odd but nice just the same
Funny pan, funny frame
Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
[Narrator:]
Ichabod may be quaint
May be odd and maybe he ain't
Anyway there's no complaint
From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane

[Narrator and Chorus:]
Who's the town ladies-man?
Gets around like nobody can
Has to be none other than
Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
[PIRATES]

[Couplet 1]
Au matin de ta vie sur la planète
Ébloui par le dieu soleil
À l’infini tu t’éveilles aux merveilles
De la terre qui t’attendent et t’appellent
Tu auras tant de choses à voir
Pour franchir la frontière du savoir
Recueillir l’héritage
Qui vient du fond des âges
Dans l’harmonie d’une chaîne d’amour

[Refrain]
C’est l’histoire de la vie
Le cycle éternel
Qu’un enfant béni
Rend immortel
La ronde infinie
De ce cycle éternel
C’est l’histoire
L’histoire de la vie

Cinderella, you're as lovely as your name
Cinderella, you're a sunset in a frame
Though you're dressed in rags
You wear an air of queenly grace
Anyone can see a throne
Would be your proper place

Cinderella, if you give your heart a chance
It will lead you, to the kingdom of romance
There you'll see your dreams unfold
Cinderella, Cinderella
In the sweetest story ever told
[Verse 1]
I've been staring at the edge of the water
ทำอย่างนี้ตั้งแต่จำความ แม้ไม่รู้เลยว่าทำไม
Исках да съм най добра във всичко но тази вода ме
Hafið, sama hvað ég berst gegn því

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ez a lázas szív fura ritmust ver csakis engem hív ez a titkos hely
Te vahi mataia e te moemoea a te ho'i e
А в глазах каждый день океан бескрайний

[Chorus 1]
Cache un trésor que tous ignorent
Si el viento en mi vela he de acompañarme
Σε ποιον να πω, το κρυφό μικρό μου ένοχο μυστικό

[Verse 2]
Ya sé que aquí todos en la isla piensan
Ta’r som fisk i vandet, alle gør hvad de nu kan
바다 섬에 사는 사람 모두
המזל, הוא איתנו, אולי אותי הוא גם אוהב

[Refrain 2]
Jag kan styra väl om jag finner tron
Ge ett starkt befäl om jag tar reson
Doch es passt in mir, ziemlich fort von hier
Was ist los mit mir?
[Chorus 2]
Credo che quella luce potrà guidarmi
Daleko stąd marzenia są
E parece que a luz chama por mim e já sabe
请告诉我，我应该去带，什么是未来

[Bridge]
I ten pás nebe dál objímá a vábí
Chẳng ai biết đâu, rằng xa thế nào
Met de wind in mijn rug op de zee kan ik zeilen
私は行くのよ

Oh, sing -

C’est moi Simba, c’est moi le roi
Au royaume animal

[Zazu]
C’est la première fois qu’on voit un roi
Avec si peu de poils

[Simba Jeune]
Je vais faire dans la cour des grands
Une entrée triomphale
En poussant, très royalement
Un rugissement bestial

[Zazu]
Majesté, tu ne te mouches pas du coude !

[Simba Jeune]
Je voudrais déjà être roi !

[Zazu]
Tu as encore un long chemin à faire
Votre altesse, tu peux me croire

[Simba Jeune]
Au roi, on ne dit pas...

[Zazu]
D’ailleurs quand je dis ça...

[Nala Jeune]
Tiens ta langue et tais-toi

[Zazu]
Ce que j’essaie de dire c’est...

[Simba Jeune]
Surtout ne fais pas ça !

[Zazu]
Il faut que tu comprennes que... Reste ici !

[Simba Jeune / Nala Jeune]
Reste ici, assieds-toi

Sans jamais dire où je vais
Je veux faire ce qu’il me plaît

Il est grand temps votre grandeur
Qu’on parle de coeur à coeur

Le roi n’a que faire
Des conseils d’une vieille corneille

Si tu confonds la monarchie avec la tyrannie
Vive la république
Adieu l’Afrique !
Je ferme la boutique
Oh prend garde, lion, ne te trompe pas de voie

Je voudrais déjà être roi !

Regardez bien à l’ouest (Ah pitié, au secours !)
Regardez bien à l’est (Non ! Non !)
Mon pouvoir, sans conteste
Est sans frontières

Pas encore !

C’est une rumeur qui monte jusqu’au ciel
Les animaux répandent la nouvelle
Simba sera le nouveau roi soleil

Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
A-rovin' over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me
Oh, the life of a pirate for me

Oh, A pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones
For when it's all over
A jolly sea rover drops in on his friend Davy Jones
Oh, his very good friend Davy Jones

Nun wird er sehen was er davon hat

Er ist verlogen eiskalt und brutal

Nun wird er sehen was er davon hat

Verbannung
Die Schande

Er ist verlogen eiskalt und brutal
(Du gehörst nicht mehr dazu.)
(Tschüß bis später, Hochverräter)

Hass und Neid
Hochverrat
Ist er schuldig dieser Tat?
Lasst ihn geh'n
Lasst ihn flieh'n
Doch dieses Verbrechen
Vergessen wir nie

Denn er gehört nicht zu uns
Er war niemals ein Teil von uns
Auch nicht ein Freund von uns
Jagt ihn fort

Einmal betrog man uns
Glaubt ihm ja kein Wort
Diese Bestie kennt keine Moral
Und auch deshalb gehört er niemals zu uns

Er gehört nicht zu uns...

Hup! Two! Three! Four!
Keep it up! Two! Three! Four!
Hup! Two! Three! Four!
Keep it up! Two! Three! Four!

Oh, the aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll
For to march and drill
Over field and hill
Is a military goal
Is a military goal

Hup! Two! Three! Four!
Dress it up two three four!

By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
Oh we stamp and crush
Through the underbrush
In the "miritelly" style
In the military style

Hup! Two! Three! Four!
Keep it hup! Two! Three! Four!
To the rear... ho!
Company... halt!

You are my world my darling
What a wonderful world I see
You are the song I'm singing
You're my beautiful Melody

[Eric]
Darling, We better be going

[Ariel]
Look at her isn't she glowing?

[Eric]
She looks divine
And you look exquisite
But look at the time

[Ariel]
Couldn't be is it?

[Grimsby]
The crew is awaiting your orders

[Various Ship's Crew]
We're sailing away from the borders
Steady boy steady
Ahoy there, they're coming!
[Grimsby]
Trumpeters ready
Drummers start drumming

[Ariel]
Down to the sea we go
Down to a world I know
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

[Various Ship's Crew and Ariel]
Down to the sea we go
Down to the world below
A journey to bless
A princess to be
Under the sun, and under the sea

[Under the Sea Creatures]
Ariel is coming

[Sebastian]
What's all the big commotion
That's spreading through the ocean
From sea to shining sea (Laughs)
There is no hesitating
Today we're celebrating
Ariel's Melody
Today when Triton's daughter
Comes back here to the water
We're gonna have a spree
The boat is nearer now
I think I hear her now
Ariel's Melody

[Under the Sea Creatures]
Lad-da-di-da

[Merpeople]
Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
Forever to be
Together as one
Under the sea...
And under the sun...

[Ariel]
This is your world my darling
One world the land and sea
My hope for you for always
Is that your heart will part of me
[All at once]
Down to the sea we go
(Up from the sea)
Down to the world we know
Together we come
Forever to be
Under one sun
The land and the sea
[Iago]
Forget about that guy
Forget about the way you fell into his eyes
Forget about his charms
Forget about the way he held you in his arms
Walking on air's obnoxious
The thrill
The chill
Will make you nauseous
And you'll never get enough
Just forget about love!
Forget about romance
Forget about the way your heart begins to dance
Then you feel the blush
When he's spouting out some sentimental mush
Love really is revolting!
It's even worse than when you're moulting
Enough of this fluff!
Just forget about love!

[Jasmine/Iago]
I had almost forgotten the way it felt
When he held out his hand for mine
My heart all a-flutter
Oh, how I shudder
The first time we kissed
It won't be missed!
Forget about 'is touch
I can't forget about his touch
In the scheme of things
It doesn't matter much
It matters so much
You're better on your own
A meal becomes a banquet
When you eat alone
Hmm-mm-mm-mm

[Jasmine and Iago]:
Love's filled with compromises

[Iago/Jasmine]:
And don't you hate those big surprises?
A cozy rendezvous
Oh, please!
Candlelight for two
Oh, geez!
Look you're calling my bluff!
(I can't) (Just)

[Jasmine and Iago]:
Forget about love!

[Jasmine/Aladdin]
I can't forget about my heart
I can't forget about my heart
And how it felt
To fall for you right from the start
I'm still falling
Whatever we may do
Whatever we may do
You are here for me
And I'll be there for you
I'll be there

[Aladdin and Jasmine]:
To wish, to want, to wander
To find the sun
Through rain and thunder

[Aladdin/Jasmine/(Iago)]
A cozy rendezvous
Yes, please!
Candlelight for two
(Oh, geez!
Enough is enough!)

[Aladdin and Jasmine]:
We can't forget about love!

[Vers 1]:
Vi er trængt af fjender, hvor vi end går hen
Hvad skal jeg med kvinder, når jeg bad om mænd?
Værre pjok end jer, har ingen set
Lad mig sige det her og nu
Det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
Jeg kan bruge

[Vers 2]:
Rolig som en klippe, men når du slår til
Viser du med ildhu, at du kan og vil
I' en slatten, bleg og ynkelig flok
Hvem sku' I dog kunne true?
Det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
Jeg kan bruge

[Bro]:
Jeg puster som en blæsebælg
Sig farvel til dem derhjemme
Det med gymnastikken faldt mig aldrig nemt
Den fyr skræmmer folk ihjel
Ser han ting jeg helst vil gemme?
Ku' jeg bare svømme, var det ikke så slemt

[Omkvæd]:
Vær en mand
Vi må være rappe som flodens bølger
Vær en mand
Med samme kraft som et tordenvejr
Vær en mand
Vi må ha' styrke som tusind flammer
Et slør af mystik, som månens blege skær
[Vers 3]:
Tiden løber fra os, snart slår fjenden til
Følger I mine ordrer, er der håb måske
Du vil aldrig, du til krigens gru
Så tag hjem, du' færdig nu
Det kun mænd, rigtige mænd
Jeg kan bruge

[Omkvæd]:
Vær en mand
Vi må være rappe som flodens bølger
Vær en mand
Med samme kraft som et tordenvejr
Vær en mand
Vi må ha' styrke som tusind flammer
Et slør af mystik, som månens blege skær

[Omkvæd]:
Vær en mand
Vi må være rappe som flodens bølger
Vær en mand
Med samme kraft som et tordenvejr
Vær en mand
Vi må ha' styrke som tusind flammer
Et slør af mystik, som månens blege skær
[Melody]
Ok, get a grip, get the hang of this flipper
It's like slipping two feet into one big, huge slipper
This way left, but which is right?
Well now I'll be circling in circles all night

[Melody, spoken]
Oh, so this is forward? No problem

I can't believe I can do this and more
To swim in the sea like I walk on the shore
Out of my shell, not closed up like a clam
Look out sea
This is me
Here I am!

For a moment all of me
Is alive and at home in the sea
I'm swirling and twirling so graceful and grand
Not stubbing my toes, getting stuck in the sand

For a moment life is cool
I'm a splash in the world's biggest pool
This is more than my thoughts ever thought it could be
For a moment, just a moment, lucky me
[Ariel]
If only for one moment
I had shared with you all I know
The sea wouldn't be a mystery
Oh why did you have to go?

[Melody]
Everything's newer
And brighter and bluer
And truer to life than before
Watch me soar!

For a moment I can shine
Got a grin and a fin that works fine
My fingers are wrinkly and I really don't care
If all the curls have curled out of my hair

For a moment I can feel
All the dreams I've been dreaming are real
Wish my mother could hear it
The sea is my song
For a moment, just a moment I belong

[Ariel]
I will find you, my darling
And the moment that I do
I'll hold you close, my Melody
And sing the song of the sea
With you
Sing the song of the sea with you
[Melody and Ariel]
For a moment, just a moment
I belong
[TIMON]
Luau!
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat
Come on down and dine
On this tasty swine
All you have to do is get in line
Are you achin'...

Yum, yum, yum!

[Timon]

Yum, yum, yum!

Yum, yum!

[TIMON]
You could be a big pig too
Oy!
We're your friends
We're your friends
We're your friends to the bitter end

When you're are down
Who comes around
To pluck you up
When you are down
And when you're outside, looking in
Who's there to open the door?
That's what friends are for!

Who's always eager to extend
A friendly claw?
That's what friends are for!

And when you're lost in dire need
Who's at your side at lightning speed?
We're friends of every creature
Comin' down the pike
In fact we never met an animal
We didn't like, didn't like

So you can see
We're friends in need
And friends in need
Are friends indeed
We'll keep you safe
In the jungle forevermore
That's what friends are for!
I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a glem
Yet I know it's true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream
[China]

The Doc is in
And she'll fix you up
If you're a toy, then you're in luck
It's okay, don't be afraid
The Doc really knows her stuff!

Do, do, do you know what's good for you?
The Doc is gonna help you feel better
Oh, oh, oh, it's the place to go
When you feel a little under the weather

Let Doc McStuffins do her thing
To get you right back in the swing
Doc McStuffins, Doc McStuffins
Come let the visit begin

The Doc is in!

Doc McStuffins, Doc McStuffins
Come let the visit begin

[Doc McStuffins]

The Doc is in!
Oh, a sailor's life is
The life for me
How I love to sail o'er
The bounding sea
And I never, never
Ever do a thing about the weather
For the weather never
Ever does a thing for me!

Oh, a sailor's life is the life for me
Tiddle-ee-um pom pom
Deedle dum dum dee
And I never......

Forward, backward, inward, outward
Come and join the chase
Nothing could be drier
Than a jolly caucus race

Backward, forward, outward, inward
Bottom to the top
Never a beginning
There can never be a stop

To skipping, hopping, tripping fancy free and gay
Started it tomorrow
But will finish yesterday

'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Until forevermore
For once we were behind
But now we find we are be-

Foreward, backward, inward, outward
Come and joing hte chase
Nothing could be drier
Than a jolly caucus race!

Hey! Hey, hey!

[Verse 1]
Ohé, ohé
Can you feel the autumn breeze now?
Ohé, ohé
It’s time to come on out and play
Ohé, ohé
We’re kickin’ leaves and climbin’ trees now
Ohé, ohé
And ridin’ high atop the hay

[Chorus]
It’s so fine in the fall when the wind starts a-whistling
We’re starting the party, come see!
The sun will shine on us all (Hey!)
Let’s celebrate the harvest
Everyone have some fun
Vive la Vie!
Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey!
[Verse 2]
Ohé, ohé
Keep the rhythm strong and steady
Ohé, ohé
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Ohé, ohé
It’s time to get your costume ready
Ohé, ohé
Yes, it’s time to trick or treat

[Chorus]
It’s so fine in the fall when the wind starts a-whistling
We’re starting the party, come see!
The sun will shine on us all (Hey!)
Let’s celebrate the harvest
Everyone have some fun
Vive la Vie!

[Bridge 1]
Oh, autumn colors all around
Leaves are crunching on the ground
Young and old and in-between
Have a Happy Halloween

[Chorus]
It’s so fine in the fall when the wind starts a-whistling
We’re starting the party, come see!
The sun will shine on us all (Hey!)
Let’s celebrate the harvest
Everyone have some fun
Vive la Vie!
[Bridge 2]
Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey, hey!
It’s Halloween and harvest time, all rolled into one
All rolled into one, hey, oh-oh-oh!

[Chorus]
It’s so fine in the fall when the wind starts a-whistling
We’re starting the party, come see!
The sun will shine on us all (Hey!)
Let’s celebrate the harvest
Everyone have some fun
Vive la Vie!

(It's so fine, yeah) It’s so fine in the fall when the wind starts a-whistling

Vive La Vie! (Happy Halloween!)
Vive La Vie! (Joyeux Halloween!)
Vive La Vie! (Happy Halloween!)
Vive La Vie! (Happy Halloween!)
Hey!
Se oye una canción
Que hace suspirar
Y habla al corazón
De una sensación
Grande como el mar
Algo entre los dos
Cambia sin querer
Nace una ilusión
Tiemblan de emoción
Bella y bestia son
Hoy igual que ayer
Pero nunca igual
Siempre al arriesgar
Puedes acercar tu elección final
Debes aprender
Dice la canción
Que antes de juzgar
Tienes que llegar
Hasta el corazón (2)
Cierto como el sol
Cierto como el sol
Que nos da calor
No hay mayor verdad
La belleza esta
En el corazón
Nace una ilusión
Tiemblan de emoción
Bella y bestia son
Bella y bestia son

I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams, my fantasies
Hee, hee, hee, hee

[HARLEQUIN DEMON]
Won't they be impressed, I am a genius
See how I transform this old rat
Into a most delightful hat

[JACK]
Hmm, my compliments from me to you
On this your most intriguing hat
Consider though this substitute
A bat in place of this old rat, huh!
No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher, something pleasant
Try again, don't give up

[JACK]
It's Christmas time!
Hee, hee, hee
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'?
Will we find a silver linin'?
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we find joy or sorrow?
Sing a song
Is it wrong?
To put all my hopes together
And wish for something better
Is it wrong?
To belong?
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other is to belong

We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's OK
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find a silver linin' another day

Ba-ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

[Outro]
Tomorrow is another day
How I hope you'll always stay
Tomorrow is another day
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Come out, moon
Come out, wishing star
Come out, come out
Wherever you are

I'm out here in the dark
All alone and wide awake
Come and find me

I'm empty and I'm cold
And my heart's about to break
Come and find me

I need you to come here and find me
'Cause without you I'm totally lost
I've hung a wish on ev'ry star
It hasn't done much good so far
I can only dream of you
Wherever you are

I'll hear you laugh
I'll see you smile
I'll be with you
Just for a while

But when the morning comes
And the sun begins to rise
I will lose you

Because it's just a dream
When I open up my eyes
I will lose you

I used to believe in forever
But forever's too good to be true
I've hung a wish on ev'ry star
It hasn't done much good so far
I don't know what else to do
Except to try to dream of you
And wonder if you're dreaming too
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Pour toi, je suis l'ignorante sauvage
Tu me parles de ma différence, je crois sans malveillance
Mais si dans ton langage, tu emploies le mot "sauvage"
C'est que tes yeux sont remplis de nuages, de nuages

Tu crois que la Terre t'appartient toute entière
Pour toi, ce n'est qu'un tapis de poussière
Moi je sais que la pierre, l'oiseau et les fleurs
Ont une vie, ont un esprit et un cœur

Pour toi l'étranger ne porte le nom d'Homme
Que s'il te ressemble et pense à ta façon
Mais en marchant dans ses pas, tu te questionnes
Es-tu sûr, au fond de toi, d'avoir raison ?

Comprends-tu le chant d'espoir du loup qui meurt d'amour ?
Les pleurs des chats sauvages au petit jour ?
Entends-tu chanter les esprits de la montagne ?
Peux-tu peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent ?
Peux-tu peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent ?

Courons dans les forêts d'or et de lumière
Partageons-nous les fruits mûrs de la vie
La terre nous offre ses trésors, ses mystères
Le bonheur, ici-bas, n'a pas de prix
Je suis fille des torrents, soeur des rivières
La loutre et le héron sont mes amis
Et nous tournons tous ensemble, au fil des jours
Dans un cercle, une ronde à l'infini !

Là-haut, le sycomore dort
Comme l'aigle Royal, il trône impérial
Les créatures de la nature ont besoin d'air pur
Et qu'importe la couleur de leur peau
Chantons tous en chœur les chansons de la montagne
En rêvant de pouvoir peindre l'air du vent...

Mais la Terre n'est que poussière
Tant que l'Homme ignore comment
Il peut peindre en mille couleurs l'air du vent !
[Sébastien]
Ariel, écoute-moi !
Chez les humains, c'est la pagaille !
La vie sous la mer,
C'est bien mieux que la vie qu'ils ont là-haut sur la terre !

Le roseau est toujours plus vert,
Dans le marais d'à côté !
Toi t'aimerais bien vivre sur terre,
Bonjour la calamité !

Regarde bien le monde qui t'entoure,
Dans l'océan parfumé
On fait carnaval tous les jours,
Mieux, tu ne pourras pas trouver !

Sous l'océan, sous l'océan,
Doudou c'est bien mieux,
Tout le monde est heureux,
Sous l'océan

Là-haut, ils bossent toute la journée,
Esclavagés et prisonniers,
Pendant qu'on plonge,
Comme des éponges,
Sous l'océan

Chez nous, les poissons se fendent la pipe,
Les vagues sont un vrai régal
Là-haut, ils s'écaillent et ils flippent,
A tourner dans leur bocal

Le bocal, faut dire, c'est l'extase,
Chez leurs copains cannibales
Si Missié Poisson n'est pas sage:

[Un poisson]
Il finira dans la poêle !

[Sébastien]
Oh non !
Sous l'océan, sous l'océan,
Y a pas d' court-bouillon,
Pas de soupe de poisson,
Pas de marmiton

[Sébastien]
Pour la tambouille, on leur dit non !
Sous l'océan, y a pas d'hameçons
On déambule, on fait des bulles,
Sous l'océan !

[Choeurs d'escargots]
Sous l'océan !

[Sébastien]
Sous l'océan !

[Choeurs d'escargots]
Sous l'océan !

[Sébastien]
La vie est super,
Mieux que sur la terre, je te le dis

[Choeurs d'escargots]
Oui, je te le dis ! hi hi !

[Sébastien]
Tu vois l'esturgeon et la raie,
Se sont lancés dans le reggae
On a le rythme,
C'est d' la dynamite,
Sous l'océan !

L'triton au flûtiau,
La carpe joue de la harpe,
La rascasse d' la basse,
C'est les rois du rap

Maquereau au saxo,
Turbo au bango,
Le lieu est le dieu de la Soul

La raie au Djembé,
Le gardon au violon
Les soles rock'n'rollent,
Le thon garde le ton

Le bar et le sprat se marrent et s'éclatent,
Vas-y souffle mon doudou !

[Polochon arrive, chuchote quelque chose à l'oreille d'Ariel et part avec elle]

[Sébastien]
Ouais!
Sous l'océan !

[Choeurs]
Sous l'océan !

[Sébastien]
Sous l'océan !

[Choeurs]
Sous l'océan !

[Sébastien]
Quand la sardine biguine des biguines,
Ça balance, ça swingue !
Ils ont du sable, ça c'est certain,
Nous le jazz-band et tous les copains !

On a les clims clams,
Pour faire une jim-jam,
Sous l'océan !

Les limaces des mers,
Au rythme d'enfer,
Sous l'océan !

Et les bigorneaux,
Pour donner l' tempo,
C'est frénétique,
C'est fantastique,
On est en transe,
Faut que ça balance,
Sous l'océan !
[Verse 1: Sue Ann Carwell]
Hey there, hi there, ho there

A-waiting just for you
All you have to do is make a wish
And watch your dreams come true

[Pre-Chorus]
If you take my hand
Just like Alice
You're in Wonderland
It's magic!
Clap your hands and tap your feet
And shout a big hooray!
Mickey and his friends
Are calling out your name
To join the Disney Parade!

Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday
You'll soon be
Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday

Hey there, hi there, ho there
You're as welcome as can be!

Here we've got a funny saying
That the magic never ends

Playin' together on a holiday

[Verse 3: Joey Diggs, Sue Ann Carwell]
Hey there, hi there, ho there
It's as simple as can be
To make a little Disney magic's really easy:
One, two, three!

[Pre-Chorus]
If you take my hand
Just like Alice
You're in Wonderland
(Wonderland)
It's magic!
A wink, a smile and then a touch
Of magic pixie dust
You can join the masquerade come on
Get ready for the Disney Parade
Yeah!
[Chorus]
We will be
Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday
You'll soon be
Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday

Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday
You'll soon be
Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday

Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday
You'll soon be
Dancin' a catchy rhythm
Singin' a happy song
Playin' together on a holiday!
[SNOW WHITE, spoken]
Please don't run away!  I won't hurt you
I'm awfully sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you
But you don't know what I've been through!
And all because I was afraid
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made
What do you do when things go wrong?

(bird whistles)
Oh, you sing a song!

(vocalizing with birds whistling)

(sung)
With a smile and a song
Life is just a bright sunny day
Your cares fade away
And your heart is young

With a smile and a song
All the world seems to waken anew
Rejoicing with you
As the song is sung

There's no use in grumbling
When raindrops come tumbling
Remember, you're the one
Who can fill the world with sunshine

When you smile and you sing
Everything is in tune and it's spring
And life flows along
With a smile and a song

(spoken)
I really feel quite happy now
I'm sure I'll get along somehow!
Everything's going to be all right
But I do need a place to sleep at night
I can't sleep in the ground like you
Or in a tree the way you do!
And I'm sure no nest could possibly be big enough for me
Maybe you know where I can stay?
In the woods somewhere?
You do!  Will you take me there?
[AURORA]
I wonder, I wonder
I wonder why each little bird has a someone
To sing to, sweet things to
A gay little lark melody?

I wonder, I wonder
I wonder if my heart keeps singing
Will my song go winging
To someone, who'll find me
And bring back a love song to me
[SIMBA, spoken]
And now, everybody, it's time for you to join in the fun as we kick off our celebration finale. The natives are getting restless - let's have a party!

This fairytale for all is the time you will recall
With stories told throughout the years
So get ready for that night when Santa takes his flight
'Cause Christmas time comes once a year

Once upon a Christmastime at Christmas
Candy canes and chocolate fill the air
Once upon a Christmastime at Christmas
Sleigh bells say it's time to prepare
It's that very special time and the magic that you'll find
On that once upon a Christmastime

Once upon a Christmastime

On that once upon a Christmastime
Once upon a Christmastime!
This is the anthem
Here's what you came for
This is the moment
Magic was made for
Come one, come all
Let's light up the sky now
You feel the magic
Happening right now
(Now, now, now, now, now, now, now...)

Calling all dreamers
Time to let your mind run free
To believe in make-believe
To be who you wanna be
Calling all dreamers
A celebration in the street
And the sights you're gonna see
Are far beyond your wildest dreams, yeah

You don't need wings to take flight
Magic don't stop at midnight
So hold on tight, enjoy the ride

'Cause you can reach for the stars in broad daylight
Heard there's a spark you just can't fight
When you wish you may, and wish you might, then
Magic happens
Dreams were made to make come true
Waitin' for someone like you
Just a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, and
Magic happens

Whoa-oh-oh
Magic don't stop (How far I'll go!)
(And...)

Aue, aue
We set a course to find
A brand new island everywhere we roam
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

Every turn I take (Every turn I take)
Every trail I track (Every trail I track)
Every path I make (Every path I make)
Every road leads back (To the...)
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be
(We know the way!)
See the line where the sky meets the sea?
It calls me (Calls me)
And no one knows (And no one knows)
How far it goes (How far it goes)
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me (Behind me)
One day I'll know (One day I'll know)
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
(How far I'll go, aue, aue, how far I'll go, how far I'll go, aue, aue,  how far I'll go)
(How far I'll go, how far I'll go) (How far I'll go, how far I'll go, how far I'll go, aue, aue, how far I'll go)

Huh! Huh!
How far I'll go
Huh!
Aue, aue
Oh

That's when
Magic
Happens
Whoa-oh-oh

That's when
Magic
Happens
Whoa-oh-oh

Recuérdame
Siempre
Recuérdame

Recuérdame
Siempre
Recuérdame

To a melody played on the strings of our souls
And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every beat of my proud corazón

Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make your cry
For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song with you
Each night we are apart
Remember me

To a melody played on the strings of our souls (Yeah, oh)
And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone
Our love for each other will live on forever (Recuérdame, remember me, yeah)
In every beat of my proud corazón
(Que) Que nuestro son no deje de latir
Y yo sin tu amor no puedo existir
In every beat of my proud corazón
(Recuérdate de mí)
Que nuestro son no deje de latir
Y yo sin tu amor no puedo existir (Woah)
In every beat of my proud corazón
Recuérdame, recuérdame
Recuérdate de mí, yeah

Inicia (Inicia)
La magia (La magia)

Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)

Na na na heyana
Hahiyaha naha
Naheya heya na yanuwa
Anhahe yunuwana

I can hear you
But I won't
Some look for trouble
While others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away
I've had my adventure
I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
Into the unknown (To the unknown, to the unknown)
Into the unknown (To the unknown, to the unknown)
Into the unknown (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Let it go (I can hear you)
Let it go (In the snow)
And I'll rise like the break of dawn (Into the unknown)
Let it go (Na na na heyana)
Let it go (Hahiyaha naha, oh-oh)
Love is an open door
Into the unknown (To the unknown, to the unknown)
Into the unknown (To the unknown, to the unknown)
Into the unknown (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Into the unknown!

That's when
Magic
Happens
Whoa-oh-oh

That's when (That's when magic happens)
Magic
Happens
Whoa-oh-oh

This is the anthem (A whole new world)
Here's what you came for
This is the moment (Almost there)
Magic was made for (Zip-a-dee-doo-dah!)
Come one, come all (So this is love)
Let's light up the sky now (I know you)
You feel the magic (A dream is a wish your heart makes)
Happening right now

Come, come with me
All your dreams are out there waiting to be chased
Just in case you feel brave enough to put a little faith
In magic lamp full of wishes (Hey!)
Dare to know what true love's kiss is (Hey!)
If you wanna know what a wish is
Just listen
It's just a little faith and trust
And with a little pixie dust
Your wildest dreams can be yours
Believin' is enough (Oh!)
Mix it with a magic spell
And love is an open door
And you can make impossible a possibility
Just find a star to wish upon
Magic things are happening, you'll see! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
If you just, if you just believe
(If you dig a little deeper)
If you just, if you just believe
(Makin' this, makin' this, makin' this mine)
If you just, if you just believe
(Salagadoola mechicka boola)
If you just, if you just believe
Try to remember that magic happens
If you just believe!

Hakuna Matata ! Mais quelle phrase magnifique !

[Pumbaa]
Hakuna Matata ! Quel chant fantastique !

[Timon]
Ces mots signifient que tu vivras ta vie

[Timon / Pumbaa]
Sans aucun souci - philosophie

[Timon]
Hakuna Matata !

[Simba Jeune]
Hakuna Matata ?

[Pumbaa]
Bah oui, c'est notre vieux credo !

[Simba Jeune]
C'est quoi un credo ?

[Timon]
C'est Pumbaa le vieux crado !
[Pumbaa]
C'est fastoche. Ces deux mots régleront tous tes problèmes

[Timon]
C'est vrai ! Tiens Pumbaa par exemple
Eh bien... Ce très jeune phacochère...

[Pumbaa]
J'étais jeune et phacochère

[Timon]
Bel organe

[Pumbaa]
Merci

[Timon]
Un jour, quelle horreur, il comprit que son odeur
Au lieu de sentir la fleur soulevait les coeurs

[Pumbaa]
Mais y'a dans tout cochon un poète que sommeille
Quel martyr, quand personne peut plus vous sentir !

[Pumbaa]
Disgrâce infame (Parfum d'infâme)
Qui inonde mon âme (Oh ! Ça pue le drame)
Je déclenche une tempête (Pitié, arrête !)
À chaque fois que je...
[Timon]
Non, Pumbaa ! Pas devant les enfants !

[Pumbaa]
Oh. Pardon

[Timon / Pumbaa]
Hakuna Matata ! Mais quelle phrase magnifique !
Hakuna Matata ! Quel chant fantastique !

[Simba Jeune]
Ces mots signifient que tu vivras ta vie

[Timon]
Ouais, chante, petit !

[Simba Jeune / Pumbaa / Timon]
Sans aucun souci - philosophie
Hakuna Matata !

Hakuna Matata ! Hakuna Matata !
Hakuna Matata ! Hakuna -

[Simba]
Ces mots signifient que tu vivras ta vie
[Timon / Pumbaa / Simba]
Sans aucun souci - philosophie
Hakuna Matata !
As the river cuts his path
Though the river's proud and strong
He will chose the smoothest course
That's why rivers live so long
They're steady as the steady beating drum
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams, you will lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for, you keep

Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true

Oh, that clock!
Oh, kill joy!
I hear you
Come on, get up, you say
Time to start another day
Even he orders me around
Well, there's one thing
They can't order me to stop dreaming
And maybe someday
The dreams that I wish will come true

Da dum, da-da dum, da-da dum-dum...

No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
The dream that you wish will come true
[Chorus]
Look out for Mr. Stork
That persevering chap
He'll come along and drop
A bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs
Like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr. Stork
And let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China
Or he'll fly to County Cork
So you better look out for Mr. Stork

Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list
And when he comes around
It's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets
And the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Quando Judex est venturus
Confutatis maledictis
Flammis acribus addictis
Voca me cum benedictis
Confutatis maledictis
Gere curam mei finis
Kyrie Eleison
[THE CARDS]
Bum bum bum bum
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red
We dare not stop or waste a drop
So let the paint be spread!
We're painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red!

Oh, painting the roses red
And many a tear we shed

[THREE OF CLUBS]
Because we know

[TWO &amp; THREE OF CLUBS]
They'll cease to grow

[ACE OF CLUBS]
In fact they'll soon be dead!

[THE CARDS]
And yet we go ahead
Painting the roses red!
Painting the roses red
We're painting the roses red!
[ALICE]
Oh, pardon me
But Mister Three
Why must you paint them red?

[THREE OF CLUBS, spoken]
Well the fact is, Miss, we planted the white roses by mistake!
And -

[THE CARDS]
The queen
She likes them red
If she saw white instead
She'd raise her voice
And each of us would quickly lose his head!
Since this is the thought we dread
We're painting the roses red!

[ALICE, spoken]
Oh, dear, then let me help you!

(Sung)
Painting the roses red...

[ALL]
We're painting the roses red!
Don't tell the queen that's what you've seen
Or tell her what we've said!
We're painting the roses red
[ALICE]
Yes, painting the roses red!

[ACE]
Not pink -
[THREE OF CLUBS]
Not green -

[ALICE]
Not aquamarine!

[ALL]
We're painting the roses red!
[WENDY]
Well, a mother, a real mother
Is the most wonderful person in the world
She's the angel voice that bids you good night
Kisses your cheek, whispers, "Sleep tight"
Your mother and mine
Your mother and mine
The helping hand that guides you along
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Your mother and mine
Your mother and mine
What makes mothers all that they are
Might as well ask, "What makes a star?"
Ask your heart to tell you her worth
Your heart will say, "Heaven on earth"
Another word for divine
Your mother and mine
[Instrumental]
Silent as the snowflake in the night
Holy is the spirit of this night
All the world is calm and peaceful
All the world is bright and joyful

Spirit of love and child of peace
Love unending that shall not cease
Peace, my children of goodwill
Peace, my children
Peace, be still
Once I met a man
A thief, a cad
With a selfish plan
That made me mad
Love set his heart aglow
So sweet, so strange
But first he had to show
That he could change

When I was in a spot
My back against the wall
He gave it all he got
And dared to risk it all
Things were getting rough
But he answered the call
He had to stay tough
And dare to risk it all
He was brave enough
To finally dare to risk it all

Putting yourself first
Led you astray
So now it seems you're cursed
To your dismay
To make up for your deeds
And prove you've grown
Try putting other's needs
Before your own
Your family's in a spot
Their backs against the wall
So give it all you got
And dare to risk it all
If things start getting rough
Just answer the call
You have to stay tough
And dare to risk it all
I know you're brave enough
To finally dare to risk it all

To save the ones you love
You have to rise above
The curse is sure to fall
But only if you dare, dare to risk it all
Te crees señor de todo territorio
La tierra sólo quieres poseer
Mas toda roca, planta o creatura
Viva esta, tiene un alma, es un ser
Tu crees que igual a ti es todo el mundo
Y hablas como un gran conocedor
Mas sigue las pisadas de un extraño
Y mil sorpresas hallaras alrededor
Escuchaste aullar los lobos a la luna azul
O has visto a un lince sonreir
O unirte a la voz de las montañas
Y colores en el viento descubrir
Y colores en el viento descubrir
Corramos por veredas en el bosque
Probemos de sus frutos el sabor
Descubre que riquezas te rodean
Sin pensar un instante en su valor
Hermanos son el rio y la lluvia
Amigos somos todos como ves
Vivimos muy felices tan unidos
En un ciclo fraternal que eterno es
Escuchaste aullar los lobos a la luna azul
O has visto a un lince sonreir
O unirte a la voz de las montañas
Y colores en el viento descubrir
Y colores en el viento descubrir
Cuan alto el arbol sera
Si lo cortas hoy, nunca se sabra
Ni oiras aullar los lobos a la luna azul
Sea blanca o morena nuestra piel
Todos tenemos que cantar con las montañas
Y colores en el viento descubrir
Si no entiendes que hay aqui
Sólo es tierra para ti
Sin colores en el viento descubrir

Quando eu for rei ninguém vai me vencer em nenhum duelo!

[ZAZU, falado]
— Eu nunca vi um rei leão sem juba e sem pelo!

A juba que eu vou ter vai ver, será de arrasar
E todo mundo vai tremer quando me ouvir urrar!

Vou dar um sumiço!

— Isso não é bem assim!

[SIMBA]
Pra fazer o que quiser!

[ZAZU, falado]
— Acho que agora é a hora, de a gente conversar... Ui!
[SIMBA]
Reis não tem que ter calau nenhum pra aconselhar

[ZAZU]
Eu vejo que a monarquia assim vai fracassar!
Eu vou me embora daqui da África!
Eu vou me aposentar!
Cuidar dessa criança eu não irei...

[SIMBA]
E o que eu quero mais, é ser rei!

[SIMBA]
Olhe pra esquerda!
Olhe pra direita!
Pra que lado olhe, eu estou em foco!

[ZAZU, falado]
— Ainda não!

[CORO]
Seus amigos todos vão vibrar
Quando a boa nova se espalhar
E o novo Rei, Simba vai reinar

[SIMBA e CORO]
E o que eu quero mais é ser rei!
E o que eu quero mais é ser rei!
E o que eu quero mais é ser rei!

Dum de dum de dum de dum
De dum dum
Dum de dum de dum de dum de dum

[Verse 1]
Goodbye, farewell
Be on your marry way
We are going to miss you every single day
So long, adieu, tata and to de loo
On my merry way
I'll always think of you
On land or sand or gravel
Or where the roads we travel unravel
It's more fun with two, it's always me and you
And together - we will stay

[Post - Chorus]
Dum dum de dum de dum de dum de dum
Dum da dum dum - dum da dum

[Verse 2]
Through warm or stormy weather
We'll always be together forever
For within my heart
If we should ever part we'll be never
Far away from each other
We'll be never far away
